      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t oppose all wars. …What I am opposed to is a dumb war. What I am opposed to is a rash war. Barack Obama’s first anti-war speech
Sometimes we have to fight back. As I write this bombs are still falling on Ukraine. A mother and her child are killed trying to get into a shelter. Beloved pets left to wander the rubble. This has been going on for far, far too long.</description>

      <title>Truth</title>

      <description>Let me acknowledge yet again that sometimes we have very good reasons for hiding the truth from ourself or others. But the problem with that is until we find our way to our truth we can’t effectively deal with our problems. Let me use my acne cysts as an example again. My mother told me over and over that I was very attractive. But when my sister was having a fancy wedding, I got a call from both my mom and my sister to make sure that I would be OK with getting serious makeup work done before the wedding pictures were taken.</description>

      <title>Mindfulness</title>

      <description>A woman I was exploring dating with asked me what my accomplishments were. I struggled to come up with an answer. I love computer programming and have done some good work on some fun projects, but I don’t really hold on to any part of my career as an “accomplishment”. The woman abruptly cut off contact after that — she needed someone who has “accomplished” something in life. That stung but it was fine, I already had recognized that she had way too much ego attachment for a relationship to work.</description>

      <title>Mind/Body</title>

      <description>When I finally let it, my body guided me to some “dark” truths about myself. For example, it turns out I love to dominate. I secretly love to force my way on people. And how do I know this? Because of how delightful it feels. It showed up in football, and when I let it, it shows up when I have sex. Initially I was so horrified about this that I carefully kept even a hint of this from myself.</description>

      <title>Change</title>
      <link>https://stwi.blog/waking-up/red_work/change/</link>

      <guid>https://stwi.blog/waking-up/red_work/change/</guid>
      <description>Change is messy and scary so we resist with all our might. But it is what we have to do. We can stay blocked for years and years, but organicity is always striving towards health and eventually something has to give. Let me give an example.
I was in Guatemala with my (now) ex-wife and daughter for a month, and while we there my testosterone prescription ran out. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get a refill but it turns out that Guatemalan pharmacies will sell you pretty much anything they have without the need for a prescription.</description>

      <title>Organicity</title>

      <guid>https://stwi.blog/waking-up/red_work/organicity/</guid>
      <description>Again, organicity simply asks the question, “What wants to happen next?” and then the follow up question, “What is blocking that?”. Let me give you an example.
I once did a series of three all day San Pedro (a type of cactus) medicine ceremonies. San Pedro is a very gentle hallucinogen that lasts for a very long time and you are fairly lucid most of that time. I did it with the same group each time, and the ceremonies were spaced roughly a month apart with a group meeting before and after each ceremony.</description>

      <title>Unity</title>

      <description>The Unity principle at Red brings us back to knowing that we all have the rapist and murderer inside of us. We all embody both Trump and Hitler. They are not separate from us. Do you recoil from that? I know I certainly do. That can’t be true! But it is.
Time for confession. During this latest pandemic surge I did the math for how many amongst the vaccine refusers were Trump supporters.</description>

      <description>“People will only protect what they love.” Jacques Cousteau
When I found out my beloved partner was maybe falling in love with another man I went through wild, manic swings. One moment I was pouring all my heart and soul into figuring out a way to fix it. Then I would get so angry I would clench my fists and shout. Then I got so sad that I couldn’t sleep.</description>

      <description>Red is definitely, by far, my weakest stage. I’m still trying to figure out what works best for me to strengthen this. If you are further along than me on this stage I would very much appreciate suggestions on what to add here.
Face your fears Even to this day sometimes when I come up to the edge of a cliff, I pull back because I have this weird fear that I will impulsively jump off.</description>
