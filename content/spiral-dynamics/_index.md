Let me introduce [Spiral Dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_Dynamics). It is based on the original research of the psychologist [Clare Graves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clare_W._Graves) who was a contemporary of [Abraham Maslov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Maslow). Both of who were exploring all the stages of human development from the highest and lowest.  Clare Graves's health started to fail before he could fully develop his theory but his work was carried on by his younger colleagues [Don Beck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Edward_Beck) and Chris Cowan. They took Grave's original theory and made it more accessible by adding things like color mnemonics. Ken Wilber took the theory and added it to his Integral Theory. He later on modified it. In this document I'm going to stick as much as possible to the original theory. Although it is a theory about individual developmental levels, from the very beginning it also has been applied to groups and countries as well. Don Beck made many trips to South Africa to try and put Spiral Dynamics to practical use during the transition from Apartheid.

Here is what I love about Spiral Dynamics:

* It helps us understand why "those" people act so badly. Depending on what developmental level you are on, the world looks very different. To those people's point of view they are not doing anything wrong. In fact to them it is clear that it is us people who are the problem! When we better understand people it is possible to open our hearts to them. And that is when real change is possible.

* The theory is a practical tool. It is meant to be of use. Please judge it by its practical benefits. It suggests concrete actions to deal with the world. You learn to stop judging people as "wrong" and instead meet them from within their world view.

* It teaches us to welcome all parts of ourselves. Even the parts that we resist. It reminds us of where we are strong and where we could use some work.

* It sets a concrete goal for where we need to go. If we can get enough people up to the final stage, the world will be transformed in an instant.  We are not yet at that final stage, but by looking at the patterns up to now it gives us guidance on what likely wants to happen next.

The basic idea is that we all go through developmental stages. We start as infants and then slowly mature into adults with different growth stages along the way. The same can be said of human history. We started as animals and then have gone through historical developmental stages until modern time. Not everyone and not every society has gone through all the stages yet.

I'm going to take you through each of the historical stages. Lets start way back at the beginning.
