Let's start. May I have your permission to dream with me? Dream way, way, way bigger than we normally do? OK? Here is my question: What do you really want. I mean really. Yes, yes you can have a billion dollars -- boom -- now keep on going deeper. This is a dream after all so you can have anything. What do you want beyond just the personal stuff? Maybe happiness for others? How about living in a world of joy for all? Wait, you can imagine a billion dollars but not that? Stay with me here.  

I'm very clear on what I want. As I awaken spiritually my heart wants to open wider and wider, and as it expands I start to really feel the suffering of the world. And I weep. I long for the world to heal. It is what I want very most. Truly. But I confess it can feel so impossible. As if I'm asking for too much. It initially was hard for me to even visualize exactly what a healed world would look like. What to do? I very much want this. It is starting to be the basis of everything for me, and yet I find myself holding back.

Wait. I really do know the answer and I bet you do too. Here is a hint -- look to the children. I love my children with all my heart and want the world for them.  And in fact I want the world for all children. Even if you don't have children, hopefully you can feel that too. So for them? yes, with all my heart I can ask for a better world. I want an amazing, vibrant world for them. It is hard to ask for this myself, but so simple to ask on their behalf. So maybe it really is that simple. Just let our children guide us. What kind of world works best for raising children? Focus on that. What horrible secrets are we keeping from our children? Get rid of that. And better yet, someone has already created this vision, so I don't have to. It is called Mr. Roger's neighborhood. Both a documentary and a movie about Mr. Roger's neighborhood came out recently. I strongly recommend watching both. They complement each other:

  * [A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Beautiful_Day_in_the_Neighborhood)
  * [Won't You Be My Neighbor?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Won%27t_You_Be_My_Neighbor%3F_(film))

This is the essay that inspired the movie, I highly recommend it too. It is very powerful:

  * [Can you say hero?](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a27134/can-you-say-hero-esq1198/)

Fred Roger told every child they are beautiful and perfect just the way they are. Great start! I want the whole world to be like that. I want a world where every child grows up without trauma, safe and secure in the knowledge that they are deeply loved and cherished. I want every child to have multiple adults that love them unconditionally and who they can turn to when they are confused or hurting. Every child encouraged to flourish and taught to recognize the majesty and beauty of this world. And just like in his show I want them to know that people can work through their differences in healthy, loving, productive ways. How can we settle for anything less than a world that is healthy for our children? It is so achingly obvious that this is what we truly want.

Does this sound too naive and simple? Consider the alternative. Particularly in the U.S. Think of the shooting of little children at Sandy Hook. If you are willing and able, please let yourself feel at least a little of the horror of all those dead little bodies with bullet holes bleeding on the ground. And it is OK if that is too much to let it in even a little -- that is exactly my point.  We have had countless mass shootings of children. And nothing has changed. So many children dead, so many parents grieving. And somehow we are OK with this. Children mercilessly separated from their parents at the border, and then somehow the government "lost" the parents. Those orphaned children will be scarred for life. And we are somehow OK with that too. Black moms having to explain to their sons how dangerous a world it is for them. As if those boys are not all of our sons. And with global climate chante there is a very realistic possibility that billions may die. Seriously. What species cares so little for its offspring? This is so not OK, but what do we do?

For me this brings up a righteous anger. I was so scared of this anger that I sat on it and hid it for thirty years. No longer.
