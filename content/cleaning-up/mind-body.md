What happens in our body affects our Mind. What happens in our Mind affects our body. It is all one. HAI works very hard to get people deeply connected to their bodies. It is one of the major reasons why HAI invites people to take their clothes off. It is why we spend so much time stroking each other. Our culture has profound dysfunction around sexuality. Many of us have had wounding around our bodies or sex. By releasing some of that shame we can more fully inhabit our bodies.
This is a beautiful method, but it is not the only one. There are many ways to get more fully into our bodies. Hakomi attracts a lot of somatic/body workers. I've learned just enough from them to realize what a deep path this is and how much more I need to learn.
