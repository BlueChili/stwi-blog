Right before my fiftieth birthday I took a personal growth course that changed everything. I had an aha moment very similar to when I originally made my first sacred vow.  This time I committed to loving myself unconditionally and all the way. Truly committed to it.  For most of my life I have worked hard at learning to love myself but it is not something you just do once and then are done with it. It is kind of like exercise â€” something you have to do day after day, month after month, year after year. And there was something about this particular HAI workshop that let me finally finally commit to loving myself deeply. I was already committed to living a deep, rich, fulfilling life. Now that I was officially no longer young, I was committed to aging as gracefully and beautifully as possible.  Every morning I would wake up and lovingly look at my belly and think, maybe a little less food would be best. And food that makes me feel good. And it worked! The extra pounds melted away and stayed off.  It felt like I was finally working in partnership with my body rather than starving it
