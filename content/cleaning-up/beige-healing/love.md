Let's go back to Aaron Stark's story about how he almost became a school shooter. What saved him? A friend's undemanding love. The friend wasn't trying to fix him, he just wanted to spend time with him. Even though Aaron had lied to him and stolen from him, his friend was still there. Love freely given with no expectations. What a beautiful, simple, powerful gift. What would the world look like if more people got the love they needed? Please sit with that thought for a moment. Maybe breathe into it. It really is the core of my plan -- my longing is for us to all get back to here. To that place where we feel loved and are willing to take the scary risk of loving others. Love is not something that just happens to us. It is a verb not a noun -- we are not just waiting around for it to magically appear. Loving others is a disclipine that can be cultivated and strengthened until it is a way of life. Simple enough to say, but quite hard to do at times. For many of us [the hardest to learn was the least complicated][1]

The Buddhists have a beautiful exercise to help with this called Metta, the loving kindness prayer. It starts with sending unconditional love to yourself. Then you send unconditional love to the people that you are closest to and find easiest to love. Then to ones that are maybe a little further out, then further out and more neutral, eventually getting to people you don't love at all. In fact you maybe even hate these people. They get included too. Eventually you get to a place of loving absolutely everyone and every thing. This takes work! It is like a muscle that has to be built up.

When I was staring so fearfully into that mirror back at the workshop I was struggling to get to even the very first step of this prayer. For some reason in our society for many of us loving ourselves the hardest step. The Dhali Lhama [was famously astonished to find this out.][2] He was told that many Buddhist teachers here had people start out the Metta prayer with people they love and then circle back to themselves later on. "How can you not love yourself!?! It makes no sense!" he asked.
