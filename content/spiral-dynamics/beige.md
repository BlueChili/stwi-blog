# Beige

In the very beginning, our ancestors somehow someway had the first awakening. We stepped into a level of consciousness higher than other animals. A caveman dad is sitting on a rock with his child looking up at the full moon. The child says "Dad, what is that?" And both feel the awe and wonder of the world and their place in it. This is where it all started. We and our ancestors have been using fire and primitive tools for maybe a million years. We don't know when we started to use language and when we became aware of I, You, and Us. But awaken we did. We now had a higher vantage point of consciousness. Something different than other animals.

This is my favorite stage. It is a reminder that we are at our core are animals. Thinking animals, yes, but always and forever animals. Here we revel in the delights of our bodies and feel at one with our world. This is what I strive to return to when I go backpacking. We are meant to be part of nature not separate from it. There is a powerful spirituality in simply fully letting in the beauty of the world. This is the level with the best sex -- primal and in the moment. This is where we go when we sit in front of a fire in the dark with friends and family and tell stories. This is the place we return to when we fully surrender to sweaty dance.

We find that when doing the deep work of healing trauma that it has to start here. In the body. [The body keeps the score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Body_Keeps_the_Score). Animals like deers, instinctively know that when something traumatic happens like getting chased by a mountain lion, they have to take a moment and shake it off. The body has a deep wisdom of its own. But what a miracle to find conscious mind inside our bodies. What a delicious thing it is to look out at the world and be a part of it yet separate.

There seems to be a longing in modern society to return to this level. This is the level people go to in a Zombie Apocalypse movie. A small band striving to survive in a hostile world where everyone is trying to kill them. This is the level survivalists and preppers are living in -- in the end you can't trust anyone else to keep you and yours alive.

And just like in a Zombie Apocalypse series this survivalism eventually starts to pall. It is not enough to simply survive. We need something more. We crave meaning and purpose. And we start to look to others and begin to see the outlines of a bigger vision.

Something amazing happened about 30,000 years ago. We see it in the [cave paintings] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lascaux#:~:text=Lascaux%20(French%3A%20Grotte%20de%20Lascaux,and%20ceilings%20of%20the%20cave.) of the time. When we stop and really look at this powerful art we can not help but be moved. These people were just like us. This was clearly the next step up in consciousness. From smallish bands we formed bigger tribes and we became bad-asses. Human population numbers started to grow and we spread out across pretty much all of the planet. Starting from this time the populations of bigger animals like Mastodons crashed. Presumably because we hunted them to death.

And spirit became the center of our lives. Spirit of place, animal, and ancestors. Deep magic lives in the sacred places. Animal spirits and our ancestors are here to guide us, if only we can get quiet enough and reverent to hear them. We fast and pray for days. Then head off alone into the wilderness to do our sacred initiation rite and face our internal demons. Then we return to the wild celebration of the tribe. You are back! We are so glad you are back! We are one. Tell us of your visions so that we may all learn from the spirits. You are home. You are loved. So deeply loved.

Purple throws the best parties. It is a big part of the draw of the hippies in the 60's. From all accounts Woodstock was very purple. We tend to idolize this stage, but movies like [Dances With Wolves[(https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099348/)] do catch an important historical point. Colonists "kidnapped" by Native Americans almost *never* wanted to return when given the opportunity. The Native Americans were living a much richer, more satisfying life.

This is the stage when art really took off. We surrendered to a higher purpose than just the day to reality of survival. We surrendered to something bigger than just ourselves. We are tribal animals. The cruelest punishment we can devise is to hold someone separate and solitary. We have a physical need to be connected. And as tribe we are strong. As a tribe life is very, very good.

And yet we know the story does not end here. Why on earth would we leave this stage? And yet we did. It started innocently enough -- we simply started to settle down into once place so we could grow and raise our food. This happened independently in several places. Why? Maybe the pressure of increased population nudged us towards agriculture. The land can only support so many hunter gatherers. To support even higher populations you need to create more food. So agriculture was born.

Archeological records show that the first agricultural communities continued the egalitarian traditions of hunter gatherers. Everyone was (mostly) equal still. But populations shot up at this point and things started to get much more complicated. We stratified into layers of society. And then a new thing arose.  We chose to become as Gods. And the next stage arose.

This is the stage of empire. Rome was a very red empire. This is the stage of Alexander the Great, Atilla the Hun, and Columbus. It is important to realize that this is all we knew at the time. Our modern morality was not yet formed -- it was natural and right that the strong governed the weak. Alexander is remembered as a "great" man, but by today's standards he would be considered a murdering lunatic. The Roman empire by today's standards was a hopelessly evil slave empire. Attila by all accounts was a self-actualized guy who achieved his biggest dreams. Too bad about all those millions his troops killed. But here is the most important point. Atilla and his tribe did not consider themselves evil. They were just doing better what other people (like the Crusaders for example) would have done if only they had the martial excellence. They considered themselves the good guys.

There is a real darkness here. Pharoahs mercilessly drove countless suffering slaves to build their towering pyramids. Brutal wars of conquest swept across the known world. Wealth and power went to the very top and if you were in the vast bottom your average life span went down.  Much of the suffering of the world still comes from this stage of thinking. And yet. We would become as Gods! Without this stage we would not have gone from from looking up in wonder at the moon, to landing on it and driving around in a go-kart. To astronauts merrily skipping along the lunar landscape. Think of what we are most proud of as a species -- conquering disease, discovering the workings of the universe, learning to fly, exquisite, beautiful works of music, art, and architecture. All of these had to start with the crazy determination to go to that next level. We were not content to simply stay just as we are.

This is the stage of personal excellence. The dedication and courage of an Olympic athlete is very red. The desire to radically change the world is very red. The warriors who fight to keep us safe have a hot red core to them. We need this level just as much as any of the levels, even despite all the baggage it brings.

But in different regions of the world at different times people woke up and said "Enough! We need something bigger than this! Life must be more than just the strong oppressing the weak". And  something did arise. Something very beautiful.
