I have a practical problem here. I want to chart a course to Turquoise, but as far as I can tell that has never been done. This is something new. I do know the healing/wisdom paths that I found. They worked for me. And I saw them work for others. But the nature of Yellow is to find its own path. It is incredibly important to discover on your own how to journey inside. So I'm going to talk about my path because it is a practical example. And I can layout some useful guidelines and learnings. But in the end everyone is going to have to find their own unique way.   

In the sections to come I am going to be telling some of my healing and growth stories. Let me introduce here the schools where I did much of this work. Each of these schools has an experiential (Beige) side that has people heal and learn simply by experiencing what the school has to offer. But each school also has a group (Purple) side where you join the community and offer service to the world.

## Human Awareness Institute (HAI)

It is hard to explain what a HAI workshop to someone who has never done one. They really have to be experienced before you can fully understand. HAI does weekend retreats where people are welcomed to a "room of love". The workshops each have a different theme but the all focus on healing the shame we carry about our bodies and our sexuality. They don't do too much explicit teaching (except for a bit on sexuality), but the exercises are designed to help people learn on their own how to connect to their bodies and be more mindful of what is going on for them moment to moment.
