## Who am I?

Before I can go into the plan itself, I think it is useful to talk a little about myself. Who is this person begging you to hope and care? What particular viewpoint am I coming from?

I'm a 58 year old white male living in the Bay Area. I have two kids (Ulysses and Jaiya) from separate marriages and they are the world to me. I've been a software programmer most of my life, and I love programming. I'm book smart so I did well academically. When I was younger I was in a lot of pain. The way I found myself out of that pain was doing intensive personal growth workshops. It was the only thing that seemed to work. I tried a few Freudian psychiatrists but their approach seemed (and still does frankly) like mostly nonsense. So personal growth workshops it was. And I did a lot of them. The month of my 50th birthday I did a particularly powerful workshop and I stepped into a lot of joy. I finally committed to fully loving myself and others. And then a few years later I did medicine work and went into even deeper joy. Now that I am mostly out of pain, my focus has shifted to helping others. I want to help people not just find their way out of pain, but into their own joy. It is right there waiting for all of us. Just begging to be let in. I want to be of service to that. After taking a number of trainings I am just now embarking on a side practice of meditation teacher/medicine guide. My intent is in time to make that my full time job.

And then there is my spiritual awakening. People who really know me describe me as very love based. I always find that description astonishing. It is like saying I am very oxygen based. Of course I am oxygen based! I am quite attached to breathing. But so are you! And just like we sometimes forget to stop and really let ourselves breathe, we also quite often forget to stop and let ourselves love. To me it seems obvious that everything is Love. Everything. We come from Love and return to Love. You know this to be true. Yes really. There are maybe only fleeting moments when this was really clear for you, but then as we all do you forgot. The trick is to forget less and less. I promise you there is an immense amount of joy to be found here.

Let me give a concrete example from my own life. (skip?)
