      <description>Beige  Color Nickname Social construct Cause worth dying for  Beige FirstAwakening Family and Kin My family   In the very beginning, our ancestors somehow had the first awakening. We stepped into a stage of consciousness higher than other animals. Imagine a caveman dad sitting on a rock with his son looking up at the full moon. The son says &amp;ldquo;Dad, what is that?&amp;rdquo;, And the dad says, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s start with Aaron Stark&amp;rsquo;s story.
  Do you see why it has to start here? There are so many, many children that could tell similar stories. This has to stop! These kids need our love and support. But instead just like in Aaron&amp;rsquo;s story the social worker buys into his mom&amp;rsquo;s well practiced lies and steps back and does nothing. Making the situation even worse than it was before.</description>

      <description>How do we know what color level someone or a group is at? To figure this out there are some questions we need to answer:
 Are they more individual focused (tick) or group focused (tock)? What do they know to be True? What are they willing to die for?  Let&amp;rsquo;s go through the color levels again, but this time asking those questions.
Beige (FirstAwakening) At Beige focus is on the individual family (tick).</description>

But here I am going to focus mainly on its principles. These principles are a foundation we can build on. They can be our North star to help guide us when we get lost. These principles work together. All of them are necessary. If a Hakomi session didn&amp;rsquo;t go well, students are taught to look to the principles to see what was missing.</description>

We see it in the cave paintings of the time. When we stop and really look at this powerful art we can not help but be moved. These people were just like us. This was clearly the next step up in consciousness. From smallish bands we formed bigger tribes and we became bad-asses.</description>

      <description>All of me, All of you, All of us. If I&amp;rsquo;m going to propose something so audacious as a plan to radically transform the world, it is going to require all of me. I can&amp;rsquo;t hold anything back. I need to bring in everything that I am. Not just the shiny parts I want to show to you, but all of my rage, sorrow and pain too. Not just the gifts that I have, but the broken hurting places too.</description>

      <description>As I write this bombs are falling on Ukranian homes. Families are huddled in subways just trying to survive, and a million people have fled the country. We cheer as we watch the Ukranians bravely fight back against what seem hopeless odds. Sometimes there is no choice but to meet violence with violence. In World War II most of the world had collapsed into authoritarian Red. The only thing that saved us was armed conflict; nothing else would do against Hitler and Tojo.</description>

      <description>Everyone has blind spots. Except me. I don&amp;rsquo;t have any. This is so obviously, amusingly false, and yet there is a part of me that really believes it. After all I can&amp;rsquo;t see my own blind spots so obviously I don&amp;rsquo;t have any, right? In other words, I don&amp;rsquo;t know what I don&amp;rsquo;t know. But this is true for everyone. We all can not see our own blind spots by definition!</description>

We are taught to venerate Rome, but by today&amp;rsquo;s standards it was a hopelessly evil slave empire. It was very Red. Rulers the world over declared themself as God. The Pharoahs built their pyramids and other rulers demanded that their followers commit suicide when they died.</description>

There is no particular reason you should listen to me other than maybe I can get you to think. But in some ways this ordinariness is actually an advantage. It is so obvious I can&amp;rsquo;t do this alone. We are going to have to do this together</description>

      <description>If you walk into a bookstore you will find books on saving yourself, but not on saving the world. You will find books addressing specific problems, but not on how all these problems relate together as a whole. There are a few books like that of course. I have made a point of finding them. But they are not well known and definitely not best sellers. Why is that? Why don&amp;rsquo;t we have even one well known plan to save the world?</description>

      <description>All of the stages come with both gifts and shadows. I will touch on the shadow side first. The part that is hurting and not working well. The part that is causing harm in the world.
Beige The shadow version of this stage is what happens when we collapse down to survival mode. Only me and mine matter. Just like one of those Zombie apocalypse everyone else is just a monster to be dealt with.</description>

      <description>Healing revolves around mindfulness. We encourage people to stop, take a breath, and really pay attention to what is going on with themselves. As people start to realize what a truly safe space they are in they feel safer to start exploring some of their scarier places. We gently remind them to close their eyes and really get in touch with how they are feeling. This is a core method.</description>

      <description>More people should be aware of the open source movement. It is kind of a big deal. I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching it with fascination from the beginning. In the 1990&amp;rsquo;s it was not at all clear that it would end up completely conquering the world, but it did. Much of the software that you are using at this very moment is open source. It is built into the very foundations of the internet.</description>

      <description>Each stage brings a crucial gift. But we can have blindspots here too. For example, Green hates Red and can see nothing useful in the Red mindset whatsoever. And similarily Red hates Green. To be sure, Green is not wrong. We are in fact living in a world of systemic racism and sexism. But what Green (and I have to admit I too) struggle with is to realize there actually is a gift that Red brings.</description>

      <description>What happens in our body affects our Mind. What happens in our Mind affects our body. It is all one. HAI works very hard to get people deeply connected to their bodies. It is one of the major reasons why HAI invites people to take their clothes off. It is why we spend so much time stroking each other. Our culture has profound dysfunction around sexuality. Many of us have had wounding around our bodies or sex.</description>

      <description>Let me suggest a set of guiding principles for this project. Something that we can fall back on when we are trying to decide what goes in and what stays out. Something that guides us as we write and review. If you find that some part of this site does not match these principles please let me know - it is a bug that needs to be fixed.
Simplicity I deeply value your time.</description>

      <description>Spiral Dynamics gives us a better story. It helps us put into context all that has happened. We can step out of helpless victim and into problem solving mode. We see all the stages and recognize both their shadows and gifts. It breaks down the problem for us into more manageable chunks. It offers us a path to follow. How do we save the world? One way is to help people move into higher and higher stages.</description>

The Goal First we need to be clear on where we are going. What do we truly want for this world? What would light us up all the way? I suggested earlier that we don&amp;rsquo;t have to over think this. Let our love for our children guide us. Let our inner child guide us. We already know what we dream for the world, we just have to dare to believe it is possible.</description>

      <description>Hakomi teaches that we all have core beliefs that are driving us without us consciously realizing it. You first need to build a loving bubble with your client, and let them really get how safe they are with you. Let them see that you will respect and honor all parts of them. Then you encourage them to go deeper. When they are feeling safe enough we take them to a non ordinary state of consciousness where they can get to the core of themselves.</description>

      <description>Living organisms are always striving to grow and heal. Always. There might be something blocking it, but that is where things naturally want to go. We need to understand that our job is to step back and let it happen. We create a loving, safe learning environment and then have faith that people will find their own way to the healing they need. This is somewhat humbling. We are not the healers.</description>

We are a deeply social animal and we are meant to form groups both large and small. We even have mirror neurons dedicated to this task. If someone is grieving I grieve too. If someone is in pain I hurt also.</description>

      <description>This is the base. Everything has to be built on top of this. In Hakomi we were taught to build a loving &amp;ldquo;bubble&amp;rdquo; between ourselves and our client. In HAI it comes from the deep love from the facilitators and the team. They are all there because they are deeply committed to love and together they create the same &amp;ldquo;bubble&amp;rdquo; but for an entire room. The very first thing the facilitators do is to model loving, tender connection with each other.</description>

      <title>Eight is a magic number (tangent)</title>

      <description>Why is eight a magic number?
Valence shells Eight is a magic number in chemistry. Molecules want to have exactly eight electrons in their outermost valence shell. Chemistry is based on this. It defines what atoms can join with what other atoms. So for example carbon atoms have 4 electrons in their outer valence shell. So a simple combination is to put two carbon atoms together to form a total of eight.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m curious to know if there is interest in this. It is kind of an amusing thing to think about. How could engineers have anything to contribute to the conversation of waking up to a bigger consciousness? And yet I think we do.
Post a message if you might be interested in me writing this up. Right now I am focused on the main path and this is definitely not that.</description>

      <description>I love movies where the reluctant heroes are desperately trying to save the world against what seem impossible odds. First they overcome their fears and limitations, and then they commit. Then they work through their bitter squabbles and commit to each other. I want to be like them. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping you do too, because the world is in desperate need of heroes right now.

      <description>But first we need a plan. Our current approach is not working. There are many things not working, but let me focus on climate change because it is a huge problem. Emissions keep on going up. World wide agreements are made, but never for enough and emissions keep on going up. Environmentalists pin their hope on elections but then the other party gets elected and dismantles previous work. And emissions keep on going up.</description>

      <description>Better Theory. We now have a theory called Integral theory that brings in all of us not just our western, rational minds. It welcomes the scientist as well as the Buddhist, and it suggests a hopeful path of what wants to happen next. Better Therapy. We are now seeing proven, effective treatments for even people suffering with severe trauma. We&amp;rsquo;ve never had that before. Hurt people hurt people. If we can stop the cycle of suffering passed from one generation to the next that alone would dramatically change the world for the better.</description>

      <description>Let me start with a simple question. Why do we think the Civil War actually solved anything? Did that war really change hearts and minds? I don&amp;rsquo;t think so. Not really. Imagine the end of the U.S. Civil War. The North has just crushed the South using brutal, total war: Sherman&amp;rsquo;s March to the Sea. The South surrenders with the bitter realization that the North will stop at absolutely no unspeakable atrocity in order to totally crush them.</description>

      <description>In some ways we are already too late. We already have launched irreversible climate change. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean we are necessarily doomed, especially if we can rally to halt emissions in time. But it does mean that we are going to have to learn to cooperate in a way we have not before. Places that used to produce food will likely become barren with drought. But places that used to be too cold to grow food will suddenly become productive farmlands.</description>

      <description>It is a pretty wild ambition to save the world. To even have a chance it will require many, many different voices speaking from a place of deep Truth. We all have our own paths to Truth, let me first start with mine.
Save the World When I let my heart open wider and wider into the vastness of all that is, I find pain. So. much. pain! Can you feel it also?</description>

      <description>My goal is to first save the world, because it needs saving. If we don&amp;rsquo;t stop carbon dioxide emissions soon, billions will die. But we have to go way beyond just that because in some ways it already is too late. Climate change is now irreversible. There is no going back. We are going to have to learn to share a very different, challenging world. Simply to survive we now have no choice but to learn to care for all.</description>

      <description>During the Trump presidency it felt like political commentators were crashing around their bedroom at night trying to get to the bathroom. Not really recognizing what they were bumping into. For example many focused too much on Trump without realizing he just represented the yearning of a huge number of Americans. Many others viewed him as a uniquely American problem, and failed to see that there has been an absolute plague of Authoritarian governments in the world recently.</description>

      <description>Everything is God (the Universe) and God (the Universe) is love&amp;quot;
Does this ring true to you? It is the core belief of the various New Thought religions such as the Centers for Spiritual Living (CSL) . The truth of these words live in my full body not just my head. Back when I was still an atheist I spent many Sundays in CSL church standing and crying as I awoke to this deeper truth.</description>
