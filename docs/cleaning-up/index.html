<main><h1>Cleaning Up</h1><p>If you haven&rsquo;t watched the stink spirit video from Spirited Away yet please consider <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FansOfStudioGhibli/videos/spirited-away-bathhouse-clip/493650414055324/">watching it now</a>.</p>
<p>We all have a lifetime of accumulated junk that is keeping us from our true shining nature. Notice how much courage and fortitude is needed just to get started. It feels kind of hopeless. I&rsquo;m not worth the effort! But the pain keeps driving us forward. I love how the whole community rallies to help with the cleaning up. I&rsquo;ve had a community stand up for me too. I could not get there all on my own. We can&rsquo;t get there all on our own.</p>
<p>Back when I was an incredible amount of personal pain, I signed up for an intensive set of personal growth workshops. The first weekend was designed to open us up to the work and the second, longer retreat was where we did the real work. That retreat was called &ldquo;The Wall&rdquo; and it was named after the &ldquo;wall&rdquo; that runners hit and then keep on going. It was described as a chasm mountain climbers might find on their path. Giving them no real choice other than to leap over the chasm. And in that moment when they are in the air new possibilities open up.</p>
<p>We met at Sea-Tac airport to take a bus to a remote camp somewhere in Washington state. We didn&rsquo;t really know  where we were going exactly. Just somewhere deep into the woods. We stayed in bunkbeds and were woken up at 6am to the shrill whistle of our facilitator dressed as a coach and were set out on our daily run. Which was timed. And the times were posted. Fairly early in the retreat the facilitator asked us to commit to our life purpose. And if we didn&rsquo;t already know our life purpose he suggested we take on the purpose of living a deep, rich, fulfilling life. He asked us to take a walk out into nature to really think about this. After our walks we came back to our meeting cabin and the facilitator said, &ldquo;Everyone who is willing to commit to their life purpose please stand.&rdquo; Everyone stood but me. I looked around a little in amazement &ndash; how could everyone so easily stand? It didn&rsquo;t seem fair. This was way too early in the retreat. Didn&rsquo;t people understand what they were commiting to? This was it. If I commited to this everything else was a detail. Hard, difficult details, but honestly? details.</p>
<p>I had only recently returned from Japan and I was still married to my Japanese wife. She was a deeply wounded woman and was emotionally and physically abusive to me and my son. I was stumping along on duty and would have secretly welcomed a death by cancer as an honorable way out. I didn&rsquo;t have much, but at the time my word was impeccable. If I said I would do something, I really would. What I personally wanted was to get divorced, but what if she returned to Japan with our son? I talked to expensive lawyers who assured me that sexism was alive and well in the court and that the presumption was that the child should be with his mother so there was little I could do to prevent her taking our child. And to be honest I also shared that same sexism that assumed that a child needs to be with his mom no matter how troubled the mom is. And my son desperately needed me. I was his safe place.</p>
<p>So no. That commitment sounded lovely for others, but I didn&rsquo;t have that luxury. I had a son who was counting on me. And yet. Someone asked what I would want for my son to do if he happened to end up in my same position? Would I want him to make the same choice I was? No, I wouldn&rsquo;t want this for him. And someone else asked me what are you teaching him by your example? If you don&rsquo;t choose a fulfilling life how he is he going to learn choose that for himself? He is looking to you for how life is done. And finally the instructor simply called me to the front of the room and asked everyone who thought that I deserved to lead a deep, rich fulfilling life to stand up. And everyone stood. I sobbed and something switched inside of me and I found I could say yes.</p>
<p>This was such an incredibly important commitment how could I make sure that I really honored it? I mulled this for a week or so after the workshop until one day at work I was switching to a new unit that happened to already have two Davids there so my new boss jokingly said &ldquo;You will have to change your name before you come over&rdquo;. I looked at him thunderstruck and said &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right!&rdquo; He quicly tried to backpeddle assuring me that he was just joking but I knew he was absolutely right. It was time to change my name.</p>
<p>David is a lovely name. Unfortunately my generation is over blessed with it. Back in high school there were something like 4-5 Davids in my Biology class. Everytime the teacher said &ldquo;David?&rdquo; something like 20% of the class turned his way. Ridiculous! Too many Davids! I stomped off to the library and looked through names. Aureolus? No. Borealis? No. Chrysostom? Maybe? &hellip; no. Odysseus? Something strong went through me. Yes. Yes that. Ok good, so when? When am I going to make this huge change? Not now &ndash; too scary, but sometime in my life I will know when it is time.</p>
<p>I had made that promise to myself and now finally I knew it was the time.</p>
