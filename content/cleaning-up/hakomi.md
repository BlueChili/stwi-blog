[Hakomi](https://hakomiinstitute.com/) is definitely an amazing kind of therapy. It will help save the world. But here I am going to focus mainly on its principles. These principles are a foundation we can build on. They can be our North star to help guide us when we get lost. These principles work together. All of them are necessary. If a Hakomi session didn't go well, we students were taught to look to the principles to see what was missing. So, again, we are back to systems thinking. Again asking "why?" to go deeper until we can embrace all parts of the system.

[Hakomi](https://hakomiinstitute.com/) started with five founding principles. Loving Presence was added [here](https://hakomiinstitute.com/about/hakomi-mindful-somatic-psychotherapy/the-hakomi-principles). Truth and Change were added [here](https://www.hakomica.org/about-hakomi/method-process). This brings us to eight principles which seems like the [right number]({{< relref "/posts/eight.md" >}}) to me.

Just like Spiral Dynamic stages spiral up and back to the same stage but higher, these principles spiral back and up as we do our growth work. In the Healing Up stage these principles can guide us on how to help people heal. In the Wising Up stage these principles can guide us on choosing wisdom practices. And in the Waking Up stage these principles can guide us into fully awakening into our full and highest potential.

Ok so we start with Healing up. The very, very first thing we need for healing is a safe place to do our work. And how do we create that? A deep commitment to non-violence. Hakomi starts here.
