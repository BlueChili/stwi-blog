Living organisms are always striving to grow and heal. Always. There might be something blocking it, but that is where things naturally want to go. We need to understand that our job is to step back and let it happen. We create a loving, safe learning environment and then have faith that people will find their own way to the healing they need. This is somewhat humbling. We are not the healers. We are merely facilitating a healing environment. It feels like a leap of faith at times to let go and just trust that people will find their own way to healing.
