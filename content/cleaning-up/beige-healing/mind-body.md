While I was writing this section, I had a urinary infection that made it painful to pee. I kept on ignoring and ignoring it for two weeks. Finally it got so painful even I could no longer ignore it so I went into urgent care and got a prescription that cleared me up pretty much in one day.  Why did I wait so long? Now with the infection gone I realize how much it was weighing on me. I feel so much better now and have so much more energy! It was blocking me from service.  

We have this weird illusion that somehow our body is different from our mind. As if they are separate things. What a strange story we tell ourselves. It is so not true. What happens in our body affects our mind. What happens in our mind affects our body. This seems so obvious but apparently I still am struggling to learn this. 

When my son was in college I would visit once a month and take him and his girl friend out to dinner. We all loved Thai food so we often chose that. One day after an early dinner we came back to their dorm and I had to crash on their couch. My son was concerned and started saying to his girlfriend, “This is not right. Something is really wrong here”. They were talking about me as if I was not there. I wanted to say, “I’m still right here you know!”, but couldn’t quite manage. I was in basically a food coma. Finally I was able to get off the couch and forced myself to go on a long walk with them. That rallied me enough so that I could do the two hour drive home. But I had to agree with my son. Something was not right.

My body was telling me that it no longer could handle high carb food. It was time for me to listen. Of course I didn’t. Give up my beloved cereal in the morning?! Give up sushi?! No way. I was also about  twenty five pounds overweight and, according to the charts, obese. I tried low carb diets as a technical hack to lose weight quickly. They worked, but then as soon as I was off the diet my weight would swing right back up. I was yo-yoing up and down ten or more pounds.  And a diet that let me eat a pound of bacon for breakfast was not in any way a healthy diet. And my body made sure to let me know it, not that I was paying any attention. My ex took to calling me “sausage boy” for all the sausages I would stuff down.
