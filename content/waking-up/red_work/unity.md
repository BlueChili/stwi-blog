The Unity principle at Red brings us back to knowing that we all have the rapist and murderer inside of us. We all embody both Trump and Hitler. They are not separate from us. Do you recoil from that? I know I certainly do. That can’t be true! But it is.

Time for confession. During this latest pandemic surge I did the math for how many amongst the vaccine refusers were Trump supporters. I wanted to see if the number of their deaths would change anything politically. The super dark side of this? I was hoping it would. Do you know who else had this kind of mindset? Hitler. Again we have to step back from “good” and “evil”. When we point our finger at “those” people there are three fingers pointing right back at us.

As I write this, I’m writing with a heart smashed into a million pieces. My partner, the one I thought I was going to die with jumped into an emotional affair with another man. He became the main focus of her romantic attraction, and when caught she completely denied she had done anything wrong. So what does this have to do with the unity principle? In my previous marriage I cheated several times on my wife, and I also steadfastly didn’t believe I had really done anything wrong. So yes, Karma is a bitch, but even more importantly I need to see that my partner is just another mirror. I might not like what I see, but there it is. I’m rightfully quite hurt, but a lot of that anger I’m sending her way? Really that anger is about the cheater in me. And now the circle is complete and I finally realize, oh this is what it feels like to have your trust betrayed. I keep on wondering why can’t she understand how painful this is to me?!? And then I can look into the mirror and see that man that didn’t understand why his wife was so upset by his betrayals. I didn’t really understand my wife’s pain because I had never gone through the pain of betrayal. My partner doesn’t understand my pain now because she has never been betrayed. She is just a mirror of that clueless man that I was.

When a car driver treated me like just potential bug-splatter, I found a crazy amount of rage inside. Enough rage to do incredibly rash, stupid things. And worse, if I’m honest I found that I really love that crazy wild energy. I can easily see how anger can be addictive. And then I look at people who go to Trump rallies to get their fix of anger. Instead of judging them I need to remember yet again I’m looking into a mirror and not liking what I see. I also could get easily addicted to rage. I also could get so angry about our broken, corrupt system that I want to just burn it all down and try something new.
