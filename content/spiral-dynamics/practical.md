Theory is a great place to start, but how do we put this one to use? I think Valerie Kaur's [Revolutionary Love Project](https://valariekaur.com/revolutionary-love-project/) is a great example of Spiral Dynamics can be put into practice.

I would appreciate it if you would take the time to watch her Ted talk. It is a great review of everything I have talked about so far. She probably is unaware of Spiral Dynamics simply because it is still not a well known theory, but that doesn't matter because she definitely makes skillful use of all the color levels.

See if you can recognize all the different color levels that come out in her talk:

She starts out with the pain of giving birth. And her family is there with her; primal, intense Beige.
She has a vision of all the mothers who gave birth before, supporting her in a long line; perfect Purple.
Her Grandfather admonishes her to be a warrior. "You will not abandon the fight. Don't abandon your post"; healthy Red.
She talks about how her Sikh religion has guided her; beautiful Blue.
She talks a little about how the lawyer part of herself is a little uncomfortable with all this love talk; classic Orange
She talks about her social justice work; amazing vibrant Green
She talks about her inner work of learning to love herself; awakening Yellow
And then she looks up and out to call all of us to join her; triumphant Turqoise
