[{"content":" “We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.”\nAlbert Einstein.\n Welcome! Thank you so much visiting this web site!\nIt was hard for me to ask you to review this. I am deeply grateful that you did! Your support and feedback is precious to me \u0026amp;ndash; it will help me create something of value. I won\u0026amp;rsquo;t get there without you. Seriously.\nMy goal is to save the world. I hope to convince you to join me. And the very first step is to come up with a plan. A plan that can work. Many people are already hard at work healing this broken world, but each group is working mostly on their own. On our own we can only get so far. We need to join together as one. So even as we do our separate work we also need to coordinate on an even bigger dream \u0026amp;ndash; saving all the world together.\nThis site is a home for this bigger plan. It is an open source website which means it is kind of like a managed wiki. Open source is a fantastic way to collaborate. Please consider joining me in this work. But even if you don\u0026amp;rsquo;t have the time, please, please leave feedback. I need to hear know what works and what doesn\u0026amp;rsquo;t.\nIt is a pretty wild ambition to save the world. To even have a chance it will require many, many different voices speaking from a place of deep Truth. We all have our own paths to Truth, let me first start with mine.\nSave the World When I let my heart open wider and wider into the vastness of all that is, I find pain. So. much. pain!

How can we use the Spiral Dynamics model to help save the world? But before I can start on that there are some points that need to be addressed first.\n Spiral Dynamics is not established science  As far as I can tell Spiral Dynamics has not yet been subjected to serious, sustained critical review. The theory is just now gaining attention, so I think getting that review is just a matter of time, but in the meantime we need to be very careful in the claims we make. That is why I am so careful to tie the major stages to well recognized historical epochs. That seems like a solid foundation to build on.\nThe important thing is to recognize that we need a better explanation than what we have had up to now. And we need something right now. It might turn out that parts of the theory might need to be tweaked as people review it, but it gets us going.\n There are different interpretations  If you listen to people talk about Spiral Dynamics you will hear important differences in interpretation. Again my approach is to focus on what history teaches us. I don\u0026amp;rsquo;t claim to be a historian, but I have an amateur\u0026amp;rsquo;s passion for the subject and have read many books on various historical periods. That focus leads me to, for example, a little bit different interpretation of Red and Blue than you might hear from others. It is clear to me that Red coincides roughly with the advent of agriculture and was the cause of empire, and that Blue was a reaction to that ruthless empire. Others might not have even thought about whether the Roman empire was a Red or Blue stage, but I think the difference is crucial.\n It might be better as an explanation of groups than individuals  People are complicated and contain many layers at once. Perhaps at work someone is a dedicated scientist (orange), but at home they find deep solace in their simple, unquestioning Catholicism (blue).

Both of whom were exploring all the stages of human development from the highest and lowest. Clare Graves\u0026amp;rsquo;s health started to fail before he could fully develop his theory but his work was carried on by his younger colleagues Don Beck and Chris Cowan. They took Grave\u0026amp;rsquo;s original theory and made it more accessible by adding things like color mnemonics. Ken Wilber took the theory and added it to his Integral Theory. He later on modified it to reflect his focus on individual, spiritual growth which is a different focus. I don\u0026amp;rsquo;t cover his variations on the theory because my focus is more on the group than the indvidual. That was Don Beck\u0026amp;rsquo;s focus as well. He made many trips to South Africa to try and put Spiral Dynamics to practical use during the transition from Apartheid. Later on he tried the same thing with Israel and Palestine. He saw how this theory could transform the world. It is that focus that I am most interested in here.\nHere is what I love about Spiral Dynamics:\n  The theory is a practical tool. It is meant to be of use. Please judge it by its practical benefits. It suggests concrete actions to deal with the world.\n  It helps us understand why \u0026amp;ldquo;those\u0026amp;rdquo; people act as they do.

We stepped into a level of consciousness higher than other animals. Imagine a caveman dad sitting on a rock with his son looking up at the full moon. The son says \u0026amp;ldquo;Dad, what is that?\u0026amp;rdquo;, And the dad says, \u0026amp;ldquo;I don\u0026amp;rsquo;t know. We call it the moon\u0026amp;rdquo; And both feel the awe and wonder of the world and their place in it. This is where it all started. We have been using fire and primitive tools for maybe a million years. We don\u0026amp;rsquo;t know when we started to use language and when we first awoke to I, You, and Us. But awaken we did. We now had a higher vantage point of consciousness. Something different than other animals.\nThis is my favorite stage. It is a reminder that we at our core are animals. Thinking animals, yes, but always and forever animals. Here we revel in the delights of our bodies and feel at one with our world. This is what I strive to return to when I go backpacking. We are meant to be part of nature not separate from it. There is a powerful spirituality in simply letting in the full beauty of the world. This is the level with the best sex \u0026amp;ndash; primal and in the moment. This is where we go when we sit in front of a fire in the dark with friends and family and tell stories. This is the place we return to when we fully surrender to sweaty ecstatic dance.\nWe find that when doing the deep work of healing our traumas that it has to start here. In the body. The body keeps the score. Animals like deers, instinctively know that when something traumatic happens, like getting chased by a mountain lion, they have to take a moment and shake it off. The body has a deep wisdom of its own. But what a miracle to find a conscious mind inside our bodies. What a delicious thing it is to look out at the world and be a part of it yet separate.\nThis level is the satisfying itch …","date":-62135596800,"description":"","objectID":"8eee7d25ef28e166468f1dae66c35f36","permalink":"https://cosmosgame.github.io/save-the-world/growing-up/spiral-dynamics/beige/","title":"Beige"},{"content":" table tr#Blue td {background-color:#00BFFF !important;}   Color Nickname Social construct Cause worth dying for  Blue TrueBlue Church,Schools The Truth   There is a Truth that is eternal and greater than us. This is what we wake up to in the Blue level. We surrender to something bigger than us. And that surrender brings a profound, sweet purpose and meaning to life. Before this, Truth was localized. Whoever had the most power and authority determined what Truth was. Now Truth is recognized as eternal and one.\nGod is one path to this Truth, but not the only way. Buddha woke up under a Bodhi tree just as himself, not a god. He taught a practical path to enlightenment that anyone willing to do the work can follow. Plato based his work on the very Blue notion that the world is just a shadowy reflection of the ideal. The Greeks had no shortage of eloquent smart thinkers, but when those thinkers only focused on selfish, individual ends they just ended up with sophistry. Nothing useful could be built on that. Plato and Aristotle gave the world a glimpse of what is possible when you base your ideas on the foundation of Truth. Science needs this level first before it can flourish.\nAnd then there was Christ. Imagine his time. Rome was confidently in charge of its brutal slave empire. And the people suffered. Christianity has a lot to answer for, but consider what happened at the very, very beginning of this religion. Some how, some way this man inspired a revolution that spread throughout the Western world. Women and slaves were recognized as beloved of God. Might makes right was no longer the highest truth. The cross which was a torture device used to keep people in line now became a defiant symbol of redemption. What an incredibly sneaky way to revolt against the empire! No armies were needed. Instead people were ready and willing to die for a belief. And the world was changed.\nMohammed is a similar story.

The race awakening. We recognize how deeply racist our society is and we commit to healing this broken mindset.

This was a turn away from the church and God towards looking for the Truth within. From this stage emerged modern science, capitalism, and democracy. America\u0026amp;rsquo;s Declaration of Independence is a quintessential expression of Orange:\n \u0026amp;ldquo;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness\u0026amp;rdquo;\n Self-evident means that when you introspect on it, it becomes clear that it is true. Math proofs are meant to be self-evident. This was the age of Reason. Notice how this puts the source of Truth back in the individual. The purpose of life is now not focused on God but instead the pursuit of happiness. And we need our liberty (freedom) to go and do that. Both free market capitalism and democracy trust the wisdom of the crowd to get us to the best answers. This was a very radical idea at the time, and yet it has worked out surprisingly well. Markets do seem to be a much better mechanism than command economies and democracy is a much better governing system than all the alternatives.\nSo when those American Black ships steamed into Tokyo, Japan was faced with a stark choice. Stay Blue and inevitably become some western (Orange) country\u0026amp;rsquo;s helpless colony, or make the switch to Orange. Japan chose to make the switch. This was a remarkable period of time called the Meiji era. Japan is the only non-western country that I am aware of that avoided colonization. It was maybe a century behind technologically, but because of all those years of peace and prosperity it had a strong cohesive base to build on.

We see it in the cave paintings of the time. When we stop and really look at this powerful art we can not help but be moved. These people were just like us. This was clearly the next step up in consciousness. From smallish bands we formed bigger tribes and we became bad-asses. Human population numbers started to grow and we spread out across pretty much all of the planet. And where ever we spread, populations of bigger animals like Mastodons crashed. Presumably because we hunted them to death.\nSpirit became the center of our lives. Spirit of place, animal, and ancestors. Deep magic lives in the sacred places. Animal spirits and our ancestors are here to guide us, if only we can get quiet enough and reverent to hear them. We fast and pray for days. Then head off alone into the wilderness to do our sacred initiation rite and face our internal demons. Then we return to the wild celebration of the tribe. You are back! We are so glad you are back! We are one. Tell us of your visions so that we may all learn from the spirits. You are home. You are loved. So deeply loved.\nPurple throws the best parties. It was a big part of the draw of the hippies in the 60\u0026amp;rsquo;s. From all accounts Woodstock was very Purple. We tend to idolize this stage, but movies like [Dances With Wolves[(https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099348/)] do catch an important historical point. Colonists \u0026amp;ldquo;kidnapped\u0026amp;rdquo; by Native Americans almost never wanted to return when given the opportunity. The Native Americans living mostly at Purple were living a much richer, more satisfying life.\nThis is the stage when art and religion really took off.

Honor   Archeological records show that the first agricultural communities continued the egalitarian traditions of hunter gatherers. Everyone was (mostly) equal still. But populations shot up at this point and things started to get much more complicated. We stratified into layers of society. And then a new thing arose. We chose to become as Gods.\nThis is the stage of empire. This is the stage of Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan, and Columbus. Rome was a very Red empire. It is important to realize that this is all we knew at the time. Our modern morality was not yet formed \u0026amp;ndash; it was natural and right that the strong governed the weak. Alexander is remembered as a \u0026amp;ldquo;great\u0026amp;rdquo; man, but by today\u0026amp;rsquo;s standards he would be considered a murdering lunatic. The Roman empire by today\u0026amp;rsquo;s standards was a hopelessly evil slave empire. Genghis Khan by all accounts was a self-actualized guy who achieved his biggest dreams. Too bad about all those millions his troops killed. But here is the most important point. Genghis and his tribe did not consider themselves evil. They were just doing better what other people (like the Crusaders for example) would have done if only they had the martial excellence. They considered themselves the good guys.\nThere is of course a real darkness here. Pharaohs mercilessly drove countless suffering slaves to build the towering pyramids of their godhood. Brutal wars of conquest swept across the known world. Wealth and power went to the very top and if you were in the vast bottom your average life span went way down. Much of the suffering of the world still comes from this stage of thinking. And yet. We would become as Gods!

Why do we think the Civil War actually solved anything? Did that war really change hearts and minds? I don\u0026amp;rsquo;t think so. Not really. Imagine the end of the U.S. Civil War. The North has just crushed the South using brutal, total war: Sherman\u0026amp;rsquo;s March to the Sea. The South surrenders with the bitter realization that the North will stop at absolutely no unspeakable atrocity in order to totally crush them. And that truly may have been the only way to end the war. Imagine though that you are a slave owner that now has to free their slaves. Do you really awaken to your evil wickedness and acknowledge that the North was right all along? Of course you don\u0026amp;rsquo;t. I don\u0026amp;rsquo;t expect you to have sympathy at this point for the slave owner, but what about their children? Maybe you can find sympathy for them? They are growing up in a culture that teaches them a certain mindset. Why do we think that mindset would magically change? It didn\u0026amp;rsquo;t of course. Within twenty years after the war, Southern whites had regrouped and replaced the old system of slavery with a new form of economic slavery called share cropping. Yes, still better than actual slavery, but Blacks could not vote and still lived in oppression. This is the Authoritarian mindset. Why do we think that somehow this changes? How does that even work? So of course there is ongoing, systemic racism in the U.S.\nThose people proudly waving confederate flags carry almost the exact mindset of their ancestors. They are not stupid, they know exactly what they are celebrating, but they also don\u0026amp;rsquo;t consider themselves evil. We do of course, but they definitely don\u0026amp;rsquo;t. Interesting. OK, let\u0026amp;rsquo;s take one more step back. How did slavery even become a thing? It turns out that throughout history slavery was pretty common. Greece and Rome were slave empires.

First they overcome their fears and limitations, and then they commit. Then they work through their bitter squabbles and commit to each other. I want to be like them. I\u0026amp;rsquo;m hoping you do too, because the world is in desperate need of heroes right now.\nPolice kill black men seemingly at will. Large parts of the population seem to be indifferent to the needless deaths and suffering of a million people. And it gets worse. Global warming is here and we are burning. Species are dying in numbers we can barely comprehend. In our children\u0026amp;rsquo;s lifetimes it is possible large parts of the planet might become uninhabitable. If we don\u0026amp;rsquo;t make drastic changes, it is possible that billions of people will die. Seriously.\nStill with me? I don\u0026amp;rsquo;t blame you if your first instinct is to stop reading. If you let yourself really consider how bad things could get it is just too overwhelming. Billions of people dying? Surely that is hysterical hyperbole? It is just too much. Sadly it is a real possibility.\nThere is Hope But please know this. There is hope. Really and truly. It is not going to be easy of course. It never is in dire situations like this. And unlike the movies there is no guarantee that everything will work out in the end. But I wouldn\u0026amp;rsquo;t be writing this if I did not truly believe there is hope.\nAgain it is not going to be easy. No heroic journey ever is. Are you willing to at least start? The very first step is to embrace the pain. Really let yourself feel how awful this is. Yuck! Why would you want to do that? Because with pain comes a precious gift \u0026amp;ndash; the energy to do whatever it takes to get out of that pain. The bigger the pain the bigger the gift that comes with it.

Not really recognizing what they were bumping into. For example many focused too much on Trump without realizing he just represented the yearning of a huge number of Americans. Many others viewed him as a uniquely American problem, and failed to see that there has been an absolute plague of Authoritarian governments in the world recently. Others only focused on recent events without realizing that this is an age old problem. It turns out that it is rare for a democracy to not succumb to Authoritarianism collapse at some point. And even more failed to recognize that this authoritarian mindset has been with us from the very beginnings of recorded history.\nWe need to stop and take the time to turn on the light and see where we are. What exactly are we bumping into? We see this Authoritarian mindset, are there other mindsets that are also driving the world? We need a map. If we truly want to succeed in winning hearts and minds we need to meet people where they actually are not where we think they should be. In my experience telling people that they are stupid and evil just has not been an effective way to get them to change. Have you had a different experience? This is where theory and models can help. We need a better understanding of why people do what they do. We need to bring our thinking minds in and go much deeper than we have.\nLater on I\u0026amp;rsquo;m going to introduce a theory called Spiral Dynamics which has a very powerful explanation for much that we see in the world. It lets us understand people without resorting to just calling them stupid and evil. But right here I want to focus on the need for some theory period.

Our current approach is not working. There are many things not working, but let me focus on climate change because it is a huge problem. Emissions keep on going up. World wide agreements are made, but never for enough and emissions keep on going up. Environmentalists pin their hope on elections but then the other party gets elected and dismantles previous work. And emissions keep on going up.\nWhy don\u0026amp;rsquo;t they get the importance of climate change? How can they not understand how important this is? Or if they do understand why is it not more of a priority? What can be more important than saving the world? If a meteor was on a collision course with the earth surely that would capture people\u0026amp;rsquo;s attention, so why not this?\nI have an explanation, but first let\u0026amp;rsquo;s start with an experiment. Take a moment to get settled and become aware of what is going on for you. Maybe take a breath, relax and pause for a moment here. Then when you are ready read the next sentence, and pay really close attention to what happens for you.\nThe very worst part of the climate change disaster is probably eighty or more years away.\nNow be honest with yourself. Doesn\u0026amp;rsquo;t that ease your concern at least a little? Eighty years is an awfully long time away, and most of us won\u0026amp;rsquo;t be alive then. But then you might argue that even right now we are suffering the effects of climate change. True the danger of billions of people dying is a long way off, but there is plenty of suffering to worry about in our immediate future. Yes, but now notice again how it feels when I reframe the above statement and say that billions might die in our children\u0026amp;rsquo;s life time. Notice how that feels different. It feels different because I have brought the issue closer into your sphere of compassion.\nWe all have spheres of compassion.

May I have your permission to dream with me? Dream way, way, way bigger than we normally do? OK? Here is my question: What do you really want. I mean really. Yes, yes you can have a billion dollars \u0026amp;ndash; boom \u0026amp;ndash; now keep on going deeper. This is a dream after all so you can have anything. What do you want beyond just the personal stuff? Maybe happiness for others? How about living in a world of joy for all? Wait, you can imagine a billion dollars but not that? Stay with me here.\nI\u0026amp;rsquo;m very clear on what I want. As I awaken spiritually my heart wants to open wider and wider, and as it expands I start to really feel the suffering of the world. And I weep. I long for the world to heal. It is what I want very most. Truly. But I confess it can feel so impossible. As if I\u0026amp;rsquo;m asking for too much. It initially was hard for me to even visualize exactly what a healed world would look like. What to do? I very much want this. It is starting to be the basis of everything for me, and yet I find myself holding back.\nWait. I really do know the answer and I bet you do too. Here is a hint \u0026amp;ndash; look to the children. I love my children with all my heart and want the world for them. And in fact I want the world for all children. Even if you don\u0026amp;rsquo;t have children, hopefully you can feel that too. So for them? yes, with all my heart I can ask for a better world. I want an amazing, vibrant world for them. It is hard to ask for this myself, but so simple to ask on their behalf. So maybe it really is that simple. Just let our children guide us. What kind of world works best for raising children? Focus on that. What horrible secrets are we keeping from our children? Get rid of that. And better yet, someone has already created a concrete vision of this world, so I don\u0026amp;rsquo;t have to. It is called Mr. Roger\u0026amp;rsquo;s neighborhood.

It is kind of a big deal. I\u0026amp;rsquo;ve been watching it with fascination from the beginning. In the 1990\u0026amp;rsquo;s it was not at all clear that it would end up completely conquering the world. But it did. Much of the software that you are using at this very moment is open source. It is built into the very foundations of the internet. Open Source out competed fierce capitalistic companies because it is a better way of collaborating. It is the only instance that I know of where communism won. No one owns open source software; people freely donate their time to it as a gift to the world. Ideas work best when they are free. And frameworks work best when many people have taken a serious look at them and offered improvements. But despite this idealism open source exists to be of use. Not all contributions are accepted. It is not like the wikipedia where there are endless, wasteful edit wars over controversial topics. Open source tends to avoid all that and stays focused on delivering value. And if it doesn\u0026amp;rsquo;t, some other open source project comes to replace it.\nOpen source does not have to be just for software. I propose that this plan to save the world should be an open source project. So how does that work? This website is hosted on Github, which is where many open source projects live. Every aspect of this site is open to inspection and review. Github supports this kind of collaboration through an intuitive interface. The Github UI is meant to be accessible even to people who are not strongly technical.\nThere are three main ways to interact with this site\nComments Please, please leave a comment below.

What do we truly want for this world? What would light us up all the way? I suggested earlier that we don\u0026amp;rsquo;t have to overthink this. Let the children guide us. And in particular, let our inner child guide us. We already know what we dream for the world, we just have to dare to believe it is possible. On some beautiful day the world is going to wake up in love and joy. But we can\u0026amp;rsquo;t just jump straight there from where we are now. This is where the work is.\nIntegral Theory The first step is going deep enough to make sure we have a solid theoretical framework. Fortunately, I think a workable framework already exists. Ken Wilber is a brilliant philosopher who had the insight that it is more than past time to integrate all the different worlds of human experience into one integrated theory. Western philosopy, Eastern philosophy, Empiricism, Spirituality, Budhism, and everything else all brought together as one. This theory is called Integral Theory. I find that it is a great theoretical foundation to build upon. It explains a lot of things well.\nThis is his beautifully succint summary of the work we all need to do:\n Growing Up Cleaning Up Waking Up Showing Up  And I would add one more to the list\n Wising Up  Growing Up We all move through developmental stages as individuals. Societies do as well. Before we can change the world we have to really understand and model the vastly different ways people look at the world. This is the map I was talking about earlier. We need to go deeper than just assuming that eveyone thinks about things pretty much like we do. They don\u0026amp;rsquo;t. Not even close in fact. And yet some how, some way we need to convince people to open their hearts to a wider and wider sphere. How do we do that? First we need to meet them right where they are and talk to them in a language that works for them.

If I\u0026amp;rsquo;m going to propose something so audacious as a plan to save the world, it is going to require all of me. I can\u0026amp;rsquo;t hold anything back. I need to bring in everything that I am. All of my mind, all of my body, and all of my heart. All of me. And all by myself I am nothing. If this has any chance of working I have to somehow inspire you to bring in all of yourself. All of your mind, body, and heart. All of you. And together as we look out at the world we need to find a way to bring everyone, yes truly everyone into it. How could it be otherwise? We need all of us. The good news is that so many people are already working on saving the world. But often they are only bringing just a part of themselves to the work. We need all of them. All of us.\nMany people are doing great science (Mind) based work and wondering why people are not moved by what they have discovered. They are not meeting people where they are. Many people are doing the intense healing (Body) work that is so needed, but are not aware of how they fit into the bigger picture. We need people to step into a larger world view. Many people are doing the profound (Heart) work of loving themselves and the world. But they are learning to endure the unendurable. We need them to come back from their lofty heights and join the work.\nWhen I look inside myself I find vast multitudes. We are so large and full of possibilities. And yet we tend to stay with the parts we know. We must embrace all of ourselves, and when we find how vast we are we will also find how vast others are as well. Let\u0026amp;rsquo;s start with Mind, Body, and Heart. That is not all that we are but it is a good way to start. The Mind is incredibly helpful in letting us see the big picture. It lets us see the patterns that led us to this spot and helps us map out what we want to do next. We need an active mind. Then there is the body where we do this urgent thing called life.

Who is this person dreaming such a big dream? What particular viewpoint am I coming from?\nI\u0026amp;rsquo;m a 58 year old white male living in the Bay Area. I have two kids (Ulysses and Jaiya) from separate marriages and they are the world to me. I\u0026amp;rsquo;ve been a software programmer most of my life, and I love programming. I\u0026amp;rsquo;m book smart so I did well academically. I am a seeker of Truth. When I was younger I was in a lot of pain. The way I found myself out of that pain was doing intensive personal growth workshops. It was the only thing that seemed to work. I tried a few Freudian psychiatrists but their approach seemed (and still does frankly) like mostly nonsense. So personal growth workshops it was. And I did a lot of them. The month of my 50th birthday I did a particularly powerful workshop and I stepped into a lot of joy. I finally committed to fully loving myself and others. It was big step deeper into an ongoing spiritual awakening, and brought me into a new phase of my life. Suddenly it was easy to lose weight because that was the most loving thing to do for myself. And then a few years later I did psychedelic Medicine work and went into even deeper joy. Now that I am mostly out of pain, my focus has shifted to service. I want to help people not just find their way out of pain, but into their own joy. It is right there waiting for all of us. Just begging to be let in. Somehow, someway I want to help that happen. After taking a number of trainings I am embarking on a side practice as Medicine guide. I am also deepening my meditation practice and after some more trainings I would like to teach Mindful Self Compassion.\nAnd then there is my spiritual awakening. People who really know me describe me as very love based. I find that description astonishing. It is true, but it is kind of like saying I am very oxygen based. Of course I am oxygen based!
