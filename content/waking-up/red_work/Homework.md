Red is definitely, by far, my weakest stage. I’m still trying to figure out what works best for me to strengthen this. If you are further along than me on this stage I would very much appreciate suggestions on what to add here.

## Face your fears
Even to this day sometimes when I come up to the edge of a cliff, I pull back because I have this weird fear that I will impulsively jump off. What was the best way to deal with this fear of heights? Paragliding.  There is something about pulling up a paraglider off the ground, turning around and running off a cliff that is amazing. Every time I do it I’m terrified and yet I love soaring free in the air.
