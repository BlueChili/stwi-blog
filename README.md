# save-the-world 

## Welcome
Thanks for checking out this part of the website. This website is a collection of articles focused on the big dream of saving the world. 
We are going to need as many people as we can find to work on this. This website is my contribution, but obviously it is going to require so many more people.

I would be *delighted* if you submit an article or changes you think I should make! That is called a "Pull Request" That is the whole point of me doing it in this format. If you find this all a bit daunting don't hesitate to reach out to me.
