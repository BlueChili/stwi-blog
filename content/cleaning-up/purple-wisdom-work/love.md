In Beige I introduced the loving kindness Metta practice. I didn’t really go into the details of how to do it because first you need to learn how to love yourself. And if you struggle with that then first focus on the people (or animals at least?) in your life that you love and then circle back to yourself. But now let’s go one step further. There is already a lot written on this topic and I don’t really want to duplicate that. So before we get into it please quickly scan through this website:

Go on I’ll wait — there is a lot there so just scan the site for now. Notice how this is yet another core Buddhist practice like mindfulness that modern psychology is just now starting to recognize as valuable. And just like with mindfulness when we look into it we find there are amazing benefits. Benefits like better health, enhanced well being, and improved relationships. It almost sounds too good to be true, right?  But if anything I think this undersells it — this practice can lead to deep joy. It is one of the main reasons I wake up in joy most mornings.

There are a number of different scripts that you can use. Find one that works for you. I particularly like Tara Brach’s approach, but it is important to find something the resonates with you. I have to confess though that I don’t do any of those scripts. I stumbled onto this practice in a very different way. For me the path started with that Findhorn workshop that taught me everyone is a mirror. And it turns out that when I looked at other people who had bad facial scarring like me this was almost literally true! But it was much easier to look at their scars than my own. First I got mindful of how I was rejecting their scars as ugliness. Then I worked on opening my heart and feeling compassion for them. Not pity! Compassion. Then I was surprised to find that how much compassion this let me have for my own scarring.
