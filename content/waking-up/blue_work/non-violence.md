Let’s go all the way back to the time of Jesus. Blue insists he was the son of God as if that isn’t true for all of us. No, he was just a dude. But oh my what an enormous impact he had on the world. Please don’t hold against him the many later crimes committed in the name of Christianity. Let’s go back to the time when Christianity was just starting.

At that time, Rome was crushing most of the Western world in its brutal, slave empire. Israel had recently been conquered. Resistance was futile. And then there arose this crazy sect that taught people to love like they hadn’t loved before. Women and slaves were now beloved of God. In a sneaky act of subversion the cross which represents the most horrific death that we all fear — slow and painful, now instead became a symbol or redemption and hope. And this sect spread and grew and grew until three centuries later Rome finally capitulated and converted to Christianity. Rome fell to this new religion despite its desperate attempts to suppress it with violence. There were no victorious armies, no great battles waged, no conquering generals. Instead what arose was something new for this section of the world — Blue. Remember this stage is the reaction to Red. At times the only answer to Red’s violence is more violence. But Blue shows another way.

Jesus was apparently a great teacher.  What was he teaching? I think the core message was unconditional, universal love. He was showing another way to conquer the world than with the sword. One of the things that give me the most hope for the future are the stories of Gandhi and Martin Luther King.
