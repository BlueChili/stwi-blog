Finding your connection with spirit, is a very personal internal thing. No one can do it for you. You first need to be open to the possibility of spirit even existing. If your heart and mind are firmly closed to it then it won’t happen. That is where I was at after my Angel’s kiss. Even though I now had overwhelming evidence of spirit, it was just too much. I packed it into a box and stacked it way back in the closet of my mind. But bits and pieces of it kept on leaking out. And then more. This took many years, and honestly it still is too much for me to fully accept, but I’m no longer hiding from it. I now know that If I had stayed with Buddhism I could have greatly sped up the process. They have a process called RAIN. It turns out that Hakomi uses almost the exact same process, but they go a few steps further.  I’ve tacked ING onto the end to address that. Note that I’m not quite exactly getting the Hakomi extra steps, but at least it is the gist of it. And I do dearly love the cuteness of the expanded acronym.

If you are new to this, you are in for a treat. This is a really powerful technique. Again this is one of those things best addressed in a book or course. I’m just summarizing here. My favorite teacher of RAIN is Tara Brach, I recommend all of her books hightly.

### Recognize
The very first step is to simply recognize that something is going on. Maybe you are avoiding something. Maybe you are holding a pain somewhere in your body. Just notice this. 

### Allow
Then see how much you can simply allow this pain. Is it overwhelming? Maybe you can just breathe with it. Buddhists hold that pain is unavoidable, but suffering comes when we resist the pain. We don’t have to suffer, we can instead (as much as safely possible) allow this pain without resistance.

### Investigate
Now maybe investigate a little. Where is the pain in your body? What does it feel like? Does it have a shape or color? Is it heavy? Does it have something to say to you? Are there insights here?

### Nurture/Needed
Next we send loving kindness and compassion to the pain. What is needed here? A Hakomi practitioner is looking for the missing experience that their client needs. Maybe safety, maybe being seen. Maybe simply unconditional love and acceptance. 

### _Integrate_
Now we have something new to integrate. We have stepped into a deeper place of acceptance and compassion for ourselves. We have found a kind of peace with our pain. It is important to integrate this. We feel better now. There is hope. We need to really bring this all the way into our body and make it ours. This is the key step. This is how we heal long term.

### _New/Not Me_
Next we see that we are not our pain. We might have been feeling depressed or terrified, but that is just what we were feeling in the moment. And in Hakomi therapy we can see how, probably as a child, we made a key decision about how life works. Maybe we just decided people aren’t safe and can’t be trusted. Now as adults we realize that we can make some new choices.

### _Gratitude_
But we honor the courage of that desperate child finding a path to survival. We are so grateful for whatever it was that protected us. And we are also grateful to find this new aliveness and possibility for life inside of us. We all are striving towards growth. Always. It is just that we get blocked at times. And when we get unblocked and find ourselves flowing again, we take a moment of gratitude for the blessings of it all.

## Examples

Let me give some examples to hopefully make this all more concrete. When I was going through my relationship crisis with my partner I went into a lot of pain. It is one thing to do mindfulness when everything is mostly going ok. It is completely another when you are in crisis. But I knew I had to — it was the only thing that could work. OK, so the first step was simply to recognize how much pain I was in. I was so busy thinking angry, hurt, outraged thoughts that I didn’t even stop to notice exactly what I was feeling. It turns out this was kind of on purpose. When I truly got in touch with how much pain I was feeling, I couldn’t stand it. It was much easier to go back to focusing on how wrong my partner was. Somehow that kind of eased things for me — my focus was on her not my pain. But it wasn’t really a solution of course. It just was the temporary fix that I kept on grabbing.
