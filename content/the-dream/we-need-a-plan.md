### All of me, All of you, All of us.

If I'm going to propose something so audacious as a plan to save the world, it is going to require all of me. I can't hold anything back. I need to bring in everything that I am. Not just the shiny parts I want to show to you, but all of my rage, sorrow and pain too. Not just the gifts that I have, but the broken hurting places too. All of me is sacred and holy. All is welcome and loved. And all by myself I am nothing. If this has any chance of working I have to somehow inspire you to bring in all of yourself. All of your joy and all of your pain. All of you is sacred and holy. All of you is welcome and loved. And together as we look out at the world we need to find a way to bring everyone, yes truly everyone into it. How could it be otherwise? We need all of us.

We are so large and full of possibilities. And yet we tend to stay with just the parts we know. We must embrace all of ourselves. And then recognize the vastness of others. How do we do that? Let's start with Mind, Body, and Heart. That is not all that we are but it is a good way to start. The Mind is incredibly helpful in letting us see the big picture. It lets us see the patterns that led us to this spot and helps us map out what we want to do next. We need an active mind. Then there is the body where we do this urgent thing called life. This is where we need to return for our deeper healing. This is where much of our joy comes from. We need to ground ourselves in our body. And finally we need the heart that gives life meaning. This is the path that leads to love and ultimately the most important Truth is found here. We need the heart to guide us.

Spoiler alert -- if I knew some way to jump everyone to the place of deep heart awakening I would have us skip straight there. Our ultimate goal is to collectively widen the circle of compassion so wide that it includes all people and even all species. Even to those that are not born yet. Love everyone unconditionally and know that we are all one. We need the heart to ultimately guide us to this better place. That is our ultimate destination. But first we have some important steps to take. Most of us can't just jump there quite yet.

### We need a map (Mind)

During the Trump presidency it felt like political commentators were blindly crashing around their bedroom at night trying to get to the bathroom. Not really recognizing in the dark what they were bumping into. Many focused too much on Trump without realizing he just represented the yearning of a huge number of Americans. Many others viewed him as a uniquely American problem, and failed to see that there has been an absolute plague of authoritarian governments in the world recently. Others only focused on recent events without realizing that this is an age old problem. It turns out that it is rare for a democracy to not succumb to authoritarianism collapse at some point. And even more failed to recognize that this authoritarian mindset has been with us from the very beginnings of recorded history. Various commentators would claim they had an explanation for all of this, but inevitably their explanation would be based on some combination of calling people stupid and/or evil. This is not so much wrong as not very useful. It doesn't point us in a direction that can actually solve the problem. What do you do with stupid? If it is severe enough you institutionalize them. What do you do with evil? We have been taught the only solution is to kill them (or send them to jail which is kind of the equivalent). That is not a workable solution.

We need to go deeper. We need answers for questions like:

* Where did the slave owner mindset come from? Why is it still with us?
* Why did a small number of Republicans defy Trump? They did this at great risk to their careers and possibly even their lives. Where did they get the courage to do that?
* What is the difference between how someone who has a good college education looks at the world and someone who does not. There is a big difference. How do we bridge that divide?

Can you see why it is vitally important to have better answers for those questions? And there are better answers. It is time we stopped blindly bumping into things. We need to turn on the lights. We need a map.

### Heal and Grow (Body)

I mention slavery, but of course racism does not just come from a slave owner mindset. When you look a little bit deeper into the problem, you will see people who are in a whole lot of pain. It is not natural to live in that much hate. That hate stems from a very deep wound. So why are they hurting?

We need to recognize how much trauma we collectively hold. Where did much of this pain come from? Quite often it was from our families. And where did they get it from? Their families. Each generation passing its trauma on to the next. It runs very deep. Of course the trauma doesn't just come from our families. Some communities and groups have a heavier burden to bear than others. Imagine the incredible pain of being Black in America, for example. But please recognize that those white slave masters were passing on enormous trauma to their children too not just their slaves. It turns out that just about all of us receive some sort of trauma from our loved ones. It is a very harsh truth. Hurt people hurt people. And quite often the people we hurt most are our children. We need to stop this cycle.

Beyond the trauma cycle, it is possible for everyone to have some measure of joy. We can teach people how to lead a deep, rich, fulfilling life. Let me say that again. Happiness and joy are teachable skills. Most of the suffering in the world is unnecessary. We have always had teachers that had powerful, hopeful messages, but until very recently their teachings were held separate. We can now pull these teaching together into an integrated whole and more effectively teach people how to climb out of their suffering. This is where the body work comes in. Much of the healing has to happen in our bodies because that is where we are storing all of that pain and trauma.

So using the child perspective, let's create a world where every child can grow and explore to their hearts content. Let's make sure every child (and adult) gets to deeply love both themselves and others. And when the inevitable pain and heart break comes, because yes the world will still be like that, lets make sure they are hugged and nurtured so they feel secure in their bodies. Let's give them the tools and support to get through that pain, and help them come back even stronger into a rich, fully lived life.


### Reclaim spirituality (Heart)

It can feel like this is an impossibly large and wild dream. How can it possibly work? Doesn't it require a kind of miracle? Yes maybe, but the world has seen healing miracles happen before. It can happen again. When Martin Luther King stood up and said "I have a dream" he spoke a kind of miracle into the world. What previously had seemed impossible became the possible and even the necessary. And one of MLK's teachers was Gandhi. The place they were coming from was a profound spirituality so deep that it resonated with people of all faiths even those that professed to have none. There were a lot of very dark moments in the 20th century, but I choose to focus on what worked. What MLK and Gandhi showed us was that handled correctly spirituality can heal the world. It is time to reclaim it as ours.

This is a very senstive topic for a lot of people. Many have suffered spiritual abuse. Telling an impressionable child that people they know and love are going to Hell just because those people don't follow a particular dogma is child abuse. Seriously. Let's call it for what it is. Beyond that Religion has a long and sordid history of oppression, ignorance, and horror. That also is the simple truth.

And yet.

There is such grace, beauty and joy available in the spiritual world. I want everyone to have access to this joy. We need to reclaim this for ourselves and for the world. There are whole new worlds here to explore. And on a practical note, I actually don't see how we can get to where we want without this. Looking back at history for examples of when we saw big shifts to a higher consciousness almost all of them came from a place of profound spirituality. Buddha, Jesus, Mohammed, Confucius, Guru Nanak, etc. are all examples of spiritual leaders who suddenly shifted the consciousness of entire nations.

I'm quite OK with you being skeptical, in fact I encourage that mindset as healthy. But try to keep an open mind on this one. I started off as a devout atheist, and I still have some of that in me. So know that I'm talking about a spirituality that doesn't require you to believe in old myths. I won't ask you to believe anything that you can't find inside yourself. But I will challenge you to maybe go quite a bit deeper into yourself than you have gone before. We have a lot of work to do and we need all the tools at our disposal.

### We are all one

And it is all the same work.

Whether you are working on climate change, racism, patriarchy, or social justice in the end we are all doing the same work -- widening the circle of compassion to include all of us. Seriously, no kidding, all of us. And that includes the future generations that currently have no say in how we are treating the planet. They count too.

We need to widen our circle of compassion big enough to love everyone unconditionally. Learn to love people exactly as they are, and spend the time to truly understand them. This will require hard work, of course. Whole worlds will have to be opened up and immense struggle, effort and yes many tears will be necessary just to even get started. But in the end this is where we will have to end up.  How can it be any other way? Unless and until we discover that we are all one and we solemnly commit to love, revere, and care for each other as we would for our very own the world does not heal.

Help me here. Does this not make sense? That all this work is ultimately the same? Do you need further explanation on why teaching people to care about the Black man dying under the knee of a callous police officer is the exact same work as teaching them to care for future generations? I'm honestly asking. It seems so obvious to me but maybe not to you? Both stem from too tight a circle of compassion. It is all too human to treat others as not-quite-humans. The work to get people to bring more people and (species) into their heart is the same no matter which group you are trying to get them to expand to. First understand them and meet them where they are. Then help them out of the pain that is blocking them from service, and then together open up to a crazy big dream of love.

So to repeat. The steps I'm proposing are:

* Deepen our understanding (Mind)
* Step fully into the pain (Body)
* Awaken to something bigger (Heart)

Do you see how they go from one to the next? Still with me?
