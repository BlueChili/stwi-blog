Theory is a great place to start, but my goal is a practical one. How do we put this theory to use? I think Valerie Kaur's [Revolutionary Love Project](https://valariekaur.com/revolutionary-love-project/) shows one way.

Please watch her Ted talk. It is a great review of everything I have talked about so far. I sincerely doubt that she is aware of Spiral Dynamics, but that makes the video even more compelling. She takes us through all the levels and emerges in a call to unite to save the world.

See if you can recognize all the different color levels as she brings them up:

How many did you get?

### Beige
She starts out with the pain of giving birth. And her family is there with her; primal, intense Beige.

### Purple
She has a vision of all the mothers who gave birth before, supporting her in a long line; sacred Purple.

### Red
Her Grandfather admonishes her to be a warrior. "You will not abandon the fight. Don't abandon your post"; healthy Red.

### Blue
She talks about how her Sikh religion has guided her; beautiful Blue.

### Orange
She talks a little about how the lawyer part of herself is a little uncomfortable with all this love talk; classic Orange

### Green
She talks about her social justice work; amazing vibrant Green

### Yellow
She talks about her inner work of learning to love herself; awakening Yellow

### Turqouise
And then she looks up and out to call all of us to join her; triumphant Turqoise
