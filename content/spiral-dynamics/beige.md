# Beige

In the very beginning, we somehow someway had the first awakening. We stepped into a level of consciousness higher than other animals. A caveman dad is sitting on a rock with his child looking up at the full moon. The child says "Dad, what is that?" And both feel the awe and wonder of the world and their place in it. This is where it all started. We and our ancestors have been using fire and primitive rock tools for maybe a million years. We don't know when we started to use language and when we became aware of I, You, and Us. But awaken we did. We now had a higher vantage point of consciousness. Something different than other animals.

This is my favorite stage. It is a reminder that we are at our core are animals. Thinking animals, yes, but always and forever animals. Here we revel in the delights of our bodies and feel at one with our world. This is what I strive to return to when I go backpacking. We are meant to be part of nature not separate from it. There is a powerful spirituality in simply fully letting in the beauty of the world. This is the level with the best sex -- primal and in the moment. This is where we go when we sit in front of a fire in the dark with friends and family and tell stories. This is the place we return to when we fully surrender to sweaty dance.

There seems to be a longing in modern society to return to this level. This is the level people go to in a Zombie Apocalypse movie. A small band striving to survive in a hostile world where everyone is trying to kill them. This is the level survivalists and preppers are living in -- in the end you can't trust anyone else to keep you and yours alive.

And just like in a Zombie Apocalypse series this survivalism eventually starts to pall. It is not enough to simply survive, we find in ourselves the need for something more. We crave meaning and purpose. And we start to look to others and start to see something bigger.

Something amazing happened about 30,000 years ago. We see it in the [cave paintings] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lascaux#:~:text=Lascaux%20(French%3A%20Grotte%20de%20Lascaux,and%20ceilings%20of%20the%20cave.) found at the time. When we stop and really look at this powerful art we can not help but be moved. These people were just like us. This was clearly the next step up in consciousness. From smallish bands we formed bigger tribes and we became bad-asses. This is the time when the larger mammals (eg. Mastodons) got hunted to death. Human population numbers started to grow and we ended up dominating all areas of the planet
