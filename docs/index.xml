      <description>Beige  Color Nickname Social construct Cause worth dying for  Beige FirstAwakening Family and Kin My family   In the very beginning, our ancestors somehow had the first awakening. We stepped into a higher stage of consciousness. Imagine a caveman dad sitting on a rock with his son looking up at the full moon. The son says &amp;ldquo;Dad, what is that?&amp;rdquo;, And the dad says, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know. We call it the moon&amp;rdquo; And both feel the awe and wonder of the world.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t quite explain why, but I know what he is saying is not true&amp;rdquo;. We were sitting in a grassy courtyard surrounded by the dark-grey University of Chicago walls. Grey, grey minds always peering down at you was how a friend described the walls, but it was sunny and we were sitting on a park bench looking at the surprisingly pretty, purple-grey pigeons hop around on the grass. We had just gotten out of class, and for some reason this brilliant young woman was taking me into her confidence.</description>

      <description>I have a practical problem here. I want to chart a course to Turquoise, but as far as I can tell that has never been done. This is something new. I do know the healing/wisdom paths that I found. They worked for me. And I saw them work for others. But the nature of Yellow is to find its own path. It is incredibly important to discover on your own how to journey inside.</description>

      <description>How do we know what color level someone or a group is at? To figure this out there are some questions we need to answer:
 Are they more individual focused (tick) or group focused (tock)? What do they know to be True? What are they willing to die for?  Let&amp;rsquo;s go through the color levels again, but this time asking those questions.
Beige (FirstAwakening) At Beige focus is on the individual family (tick).</description>

We see it in the cave paintings of the time. When we stop and really look at this powerful art we can not help but be moved. These people were just like us. This was clearly the next step up in consciousness. From smallish bands we formed bigger tribes and we became bad-asses.</description>

      <description>How do I know what is true and what is false? This is a surprisingly deep question, and surprisingly few people ever think much about it. Or then again, perhaps it isn&amp;rsquo;t surprising. Whether we are aware of it or not we all have mental machinery humming along that helps us make the countless choices we need to make. Most of us instinctually recognize that messing with this machinery might cause a person&amp;rsquo;s life to break down.</description>

      <description>Non violence Mindfulness Mind/Body Truth Change Organicity Unity Loving Presence  These principles are a foundation we can build on. They can be our North star to help guide us when we get lost. These principles work together. All of them are necessary. If a Hakomi session didn&amp;rsquo;t go well, students are taught to look to the principles to see what was missing. This brings us back to systems thinking.</description>

      <description>As I write this bombs are falling on Ukranian homes. Families are huddled in subways just trying to survive, and millions upon millions of people have fled the country. We cheer as we watch the Ukranians bravely fight back against what seem hopeless odds. Sometimes there is no choice but to meet violence with violence. In World War II most of the world had collapsed into authoritarian Red. The only thing that saved us was armed conflict; nothing else would do against Hitler and Tojo.</description>

      <description>Everyone has blind spots. Except me. I don&amp;rsquo;t have any. This deeply amuses me because it is so obviously false, and yet there is a part of me that really believes it. After all I can&amp;rsquo;t see my own blind spots so obviously I don&amp;rsquo;t have any, right? In other words, I don&amp;rsquo;t know what I don&amp;rsquo;t know. But this is true for everyone. We all can not see our own blind spots by definition!</description>

We are taught to venerate Rome, but by today&amp;rsquo;s standards it was a hopelessly evil slave empire. It was very Red. Rulers the world over declared themself as God. The Pharoahs built their pyramids and other rulers demanded that their followers commit suicide when they died.</description>

      <description>Who am I to save the world? I am just this nobody on the internet. I don&amp;rsquo;t have any particular expertise or credentials. There is no particular reason you should listen to me other than maybe I can get you to think. But in some ways this ordinariness is actually an advantage. It is so obvious I can&amp;rsquo;t do this alone. We are going to have to do this together</description>

      <description>If you walk into a bookstore you will find books on saving yourself, but not on saving the world. You will find books addressing specific problems, but not on how all these problems relate together as a whole. There are a few books like that of course. I have made a point of finding them. But they are not well known and definitely not best sellers. Why is that? Why don&amp;rsquo;t we have even one well known plan to save the world?</description>

      <description>In my thirties I ended up in a lot of pain. I longed for a release from this pain, and on a subconscious level suicide might even have been starting to look attractive. At least it all would be over then. I tried talk therapy, but was deeply unimpressed with that method, although it seems to have worked for others. Then I stumbled onto some mildly radical personal growth seminars. I absolutely loved them.</description>

      <description>But I didn&amp;rsquo;t know all this when I was sitting back there on that picnic bench at U. of C. It took a long personal journey before I learned to trust other sources of knowledge other than pure reason. To most people this is hardly a discovery - my wife laughs that I was ever in doubt about it. But, I wish someone would have explained this to me when I was younger.</description>

      <description>In class we studied how formal reasoning works. It turns out that any formal reasoning system starts out with basic assumptions (called axioms) and works up from there. No useful logical system can be built without these assumptions, but these assumptions have to be taken on faith - they are outside of the system. So many arguments are pointless because the participants are starting with radically different assumptions. Given how enormously important our assumptions are, it is shocking how unaware we typically are of them.</description>

      <description>All of the stages come with both gifts and shadows. I will touch on the shadow side first. The part that is hurting and not working well. The part that is causing harm in the world.
Beige The shadow version of this stage is what happens when we collapse down to survival mode. Only me and mine matter. Just like one of those Zombie apocalypse everyone else is just a monster to be dealt with.</description>

      <description>More people should be aware of the open source movement. It is kind of a big deal. I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching it with fascination from the beginning. In the 1990&amp;rsquo;s it was not at all clear that it would end up completely conquering the world, but it did. Much of the software that you are using at this very moment is open source. It is built into the very foundations of the internet.</description>

      <description>We need to find our truth before we can heal. Hakomi gently guides clients deeper and deeper into a non ordinary state of consciousness that helps them get all the way down to their core beliefs. These are the (mostly) unconscious beliefs people have about how the world works. What is and is not safe. These beliefs are usually created by a child desperately trying to survive against unfair odds. So we honor the genius of that child for finding something that worked, but then help them see how that solution also has come with a price.</description>

      <description>Each stage brings a crucial gift. But we can have blindspots here too. For example, Green hates Red and can see nothing useful in the Red mindset whatsoever. And similarily Red hates Green. To be sure, Green is not wrong. We are in fact living in a world of systemic racism and sexism. But what Green (and I have to admit I too) struggle with is to realize there actually is a gift that Red brings.</description>

      <description>I suggest we run this site the way open source projects usually run. Programmers kind of just know how it works but let me try and make the underlying principles clear here. The goal is to come up with something that we can fall back on when we are trying to decide what goes in and what stays out. Something that guides us as we write and review. If you find that some part of this site does not match these guidelines please let me know - it is a bug that needs to be fixed.</description>

      <description>There is a lot of truly great writing about mindfulness. For example, Mark Manson has an excellent article here. He writes in his vivid way of all the amazing benefits both health-wise and mental. But in that article he lightly touches upon something that is often overlooked. We tend to think of meditation as the only way to cultivate mindfulness. It is not. Meditation is not the answer to all our problems.</description>

      <description>Before I talked about Descartes&#39; (and my) assumption that the rational mind is the center and everything else, including our bodies, revolves around it. I now believe just the opposite - it is our bodies that are the center and everything else, including our rational minds, revolves around the body. The proof for this statement is not in thinking about it rationally, but to instead introspect and remember the states that you have been to, and to at least be open to the possibility of finding other states.</description>

      <description>We have this weird illusion that somehow our body is separate from our mind. As if they are separate things. What a strange story we tell ourselves. It is so not true. What happens in our body affects our Mind. What happens in our Mind affects our body. It is all one. When we suffer a traumatic event we store that trauma somewhere in our body. In his book The body keeps the score, the psychiatrist Bessel van der Kolk talks about how when he first started out as a therapist working with traumatized people, his profession didn&amp;rsquo;t have much to offer.</description>

      <description>So how are we going to do this? What does the plan look like?
The Goal First we need to be clear on where we are going. What do we truly want for this world? What would light us up all the way? I suggested earlier that we don&amp;rsquo;t have to over think this. Let our love for our children guide us. Let our inner child guide us. We already know what we dream for the world, we just have to dare to believe it is possible.</description>

      <description>Life is a rich and varied banquet. Rationalists that stay safe in only their rational minds are missing out on the full richness of being human. When I try to talk about this with my rationalist friends it is somewhat frustrating - I end up basically saying, yes, pizza is one of my favorite foods too, but there is so much else out there as well, why not do a little more exploring?</description>

      <description>Gödel Escher Bach By Douglas R. Hofstadter
If you feel like exploring your rational mind, this is definitely the book for you. This is the best book I&amp;rsquo;ve seen for explaining the rational method. Amongst his other themes Hofstadter does a great job of explaining Goedel&amp;rsquo;s theorem.   The Multi Orgasmic Couple By Mantak Chia and Maneen Chia, Douglas Abrams and Rachel Abrams.
In very down to earth practical terms shows how both men and women can focus their minds and bodies to achieve multiple orgasms.</description>

      <title>Towards Turqoise</title>

      <description>When I first learned about Spiral Dynamics I had an aha! moment. Finally I had a story that explained where I am at. I have been deepening into Yellow and now Turqoise is wanting to wake up in me. I initially hoped that simply telling people the Spiral Dynamics story would waken them to the same longing for Turqoise that I have. But nope. I feel like a popcorn kernel that has popped a little earlier than the rest.</description>

      <description>I don’t think people are seeking the meaning of life as much as they are seeking the experience of being alive.” Joseph Campbell
 &amp;ldquo;Organicity&amp;rdquo; is an unfamiliar, awkward word, and I have to confess I initially resisted it. But that resistance was mostly because it is awkward to learn something truly new. Ignore what the dictionary might say, in this sense the word combines &amp;ldquo;organism&amp;rdquo; with &amp;ldquo;icity&amp;rdquo; to mean the nature of an organism.</description>

      <description>Color Nickname Social construct Cause worth dying for  Yellow SecondAwakening Integral Theory, personal growth movement, medicine movement A life worth living   At some point we need to turn back to ourselves to find the Truth of things. We have absorbed the lessons of Green, and yet we are not at peace with ourselves. Green by itself won&amp;rsquo;t get us to the healing we need. Green by itself won&amp;rsquo;t heal the world.</description>

And it hurts. Really hurts. The world is suffering in so many needless ways. We have met this pain before and run away, but this time we suddenly realize how truly big we are.</description>

      <description>There is a certain connection magic that always comes up for a group that goes through something intense together. People connect and become one. It is part of being human. We are a deeply social animal and we are meant to form groups both large and small. We even have mirror neurons dedicated to this task. If someone is grieving I grieve too. If someone is in pain I hurt also.</description>

      <description>“People will only protect what they love.” Jacques Coustea
 Love is the base. Everything has to be built on top of this. In Hakomi we were taught to build a loving &amp;ldquo;bubble&amp;rdquo; between ourselves and our client. In HAI it comes from the deep love from the facilitators and the team. They are all there because they are deeply committed to love and together they create the same &amp;ldquo;bubble&amp;rdquo; but for an entire room.</description>

      <description>Everything is God (the Universe) and God (the Universe) is love&amp;quot;
Does this ring true to you? It is the core belief of the various New Thought religions such as the Centers for Spiritual Living (CSL) . The truth of these words live in my full body not just my head. Back when I was still an atheist I spent many Sundays in CSL church standing and crying as I awoke to this deeper truth.</description>

      <title>Eight is a magic number (tangent)</title>
      <link>https://cosmosgame.github.io/save-the-world/posts/eight/</link>

      <description>Why is eight a magic number?
Valence shells Eight is a magic number in chemistry. Molecules want to have exactly eight electrons in their outermost valence shell. Chemistry is based on this. It defines what atoms can join with what other atoms. So for example carbon atoms have 4 electrons in their outer valence shell. So a simple combination is to put two carbon atoms together to form a total of eight.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m curious to know if there is interest in this. It is kind of an amusing thing to think about. How could engineers have anything to contribute to the conversation of waking up to a bigger consciousness? And yet I think we do.
Post a message if you might be interested in me writing this up. Right now I am focused on the main path and this is definitely not that.</description>
