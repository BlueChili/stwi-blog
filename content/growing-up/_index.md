Earlier I promised a much more clearer explanation for things like why we had the Trump presidency. In this section we are going to answer questions like:

* Where did the authoritarian slave owner mindset come from? Why is it still with us?
* Why did a small number of Republicans defy Trump? They did this at great risk to their careers and possibly even their lives. Where did they get the courage to do that?
* What is the difference between how someone who has a good college education looks at the world and someone who does not. There is a big difference. How do we bridge that divide?

It turns out that a theory called Spiral Dynamics provides useful answers to these questions. I call it a theory, but it might be better understood as a unifying story that helps us make sense of things. I'm going to talk about it in this section.

First I will explain the basics of the theory/story, and then I will dive into how it can be put to practical use, including answering the above questions.
