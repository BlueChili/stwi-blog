* Non violence
* Mindfulness
* Mind/Body
* Truth
* Change
* Organicity
* Unity
* Loving Presence

These principles are a foundation we can build on. They can be our North star to help guide us when we get lost. They work together. All of them are necessary. If a Hakomi session didn't go well, students are taught to look to the principles to see what was missing. This brings us back to systems thinking. Asking "why?" to go deeper and deeper so that we can embrace all parts of the system.

[Hakomi](https://hakomiinstitute.com/) started with five founding principles. Loving Presence was added [here](https://hakomiinstitute.com/about/hakomi-mindful-somatic-psychotherapy/the-hakomi-principles). Truth and Change were added [here](https://www.hakomica.org/about-hakomi/method-process). This brings us to eight principles which seems like the [right number]({{< relref "/posts/eight.md" >}}) to me.

These principles guide a therapist when working with a client. But they also can guide our lives. We can use them to guide us on how to do our ongoing Healing Up work. We also can use them as a foundation for the life practices of Wising Up. We can even use them for inspiration when finding our way to spirt and soul in our Waking Up work.

## Truth

"Get curious about that", is a standard Hakomi invitation. Hakomi helps clients find their way to their core truth; their core story. This truth is usually too hard or scary to get to all on our own so we need help. And that is the place where healing can happen. We have to get to the deeper truth of things before we can make a change. We have to know our story before we can change it. Trying to play it safe and stay at the surface does not really work.

We should always be on a quest for the deeper truth. Sometimes we need help getting there, sometimes we can get there on our own, but there is always a deeper truth remaining to be found.

## Non violence

"I welcome that strong protector -- it has kept you safe". Hakomi doesn't shame people for their defenses instead it celebrates what good work that defense has done for them.

As I mentioned earlier, getting to our core truth is delicate sensitive work and the slightest hint of judgment can stop the process in an instant. We all originally had very good reasons for our defenses. Healing comes from within. We are ready to change our core story only when we are ready. It does not help to push -- it actually makes it worse.

Beyond that we have to come to terms with the harsh inner critic that we all have. We need to renounce this violence against ourselves. Maybe the most important thing is to learn to deeply love ourselves. That all by itself can help so much.

## Mindfulness

"Check inside and see what is going on for you". This is the classic invitation to mindfulness. This is the first step towards the truth. What is actually going on for me at the moment? Not what I think should be happening or what is appropriate but what is actually going on.

For example: "My partner is having this wonderful connection with their friend, ... and I'm feeling jealous. Maybe I shouldn't be but there it is" or "Wow. I don't know why but I'm feeling sad in this moment. Huh. When I stop resisting it the sadness gets that much stronger" or "Wow! I'm feeling so aware of all the people at this concert -- they are so interesting and amazing!"

## Mind/Body

"Where do you feel it in your body?" This is the classic Hakomi question. I've asked my partner this question so many times it now has become a joke between us, and it is on the list of questions I never get to ask her again. But healing starts when we connect back to our body. Hakomi sessions get people to notice what is happening in our bodies. Mindfulness takes us to what is happening right now but then we want to know where do we feel it? Your heart? There is a pain there? It feels like a hand gripping too hard? OK, as much as you are able to please let yourself really feel that gripping hand.

## Organicity

"I wonder what wants to happen next"

## Unity

"I'm feeling a lot of sadness. Is there sadness here for you?"

## Change
## Loving Presence
