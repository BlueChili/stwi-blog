      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s start with Aaron Stark&amp;rsquo;s story.
  Do you see why it has to start here? There are so many, many children that could tell similar stories. This has to stop! These kids need our love and support. But instead just like in Aaron&amp;rsquo;s story the social worker buys into his mom&amp;rsquo;s well practiced lies and steps back and does nothing. Making the situation even worse than it was before.</description>

      <description>Non violence Mindfulness Mind/Body Truth Change Organicity Unity Loving Presence  Hakomi therapists are working to save the world. But here I am going to focus mainly on its principles. These principles are a foundation we can build on. They can be our North star to help guide us when we get lost. These principles work together. All of them are necessary. If a Hakomi session didn&amp;rsquo;t go well, students are taught to look to the principles to see what was missing.</description>

      <description>As I write this bombs are falling on Ukranian homes. Families are huddled in subways just trying to survive, and millions of people have fled the country. We cheer as we watch the Ukranians bravely fight back against what seem hopeless odds. Sometimes there is no choice but to meet violence with violence. In World War II most of the world had collapsed into authoritarian Red. The only thing that saved us was armed conflict; nothing else would do against Hitler and Tojo.</description>

      <description>We need to find our truth before we can heal. Hakomi gently guides clients deeper and deeper into a non ordinary state of consciousness that helps them get all the way down to their core beliefs. These are the (mostly) unconscious beliefs people have about how the world works. What is and is not safe. These beliefs are usually created by a child desperately trying to survive against unfair odds. So we honor the genius of that child for finding something that worked, but then help them see how that solution also has come with a price.</description>

      <title>Mindfulness</title>

      <description>There is a lot of truly great writing about mindfulness. For example, Mark Manson has an excellent article here. He writes in his vivid way of all the amazing benefits both healthwise and mental. But in that article he lightly touches upon something that is often overlooked. We tend to think of meditation as the only way to cultivate mindfulness. It is not. Meditation is not the answer to all our problems.</description>

      <description>We have this weird illusion that somehow our body is separate from our mind. As if they are separate things. What a strange story we tell ourselves. It is so not true. What happens in our body affects our Mind. What happens in our Mind affects our body. It is all one. When we suffer a traumatic event we store that trauma somewhere in our body. In his book The body keeps the score, the psychiatrist Bessel van der Kolk talks about how when he first started out as a therapist working with traumatized people, his profession didn&amp;rsquo;t have much to offer.</description>

      <description>Living organisms are always striving to grow and heal. Always. There might be something blocking it, but that is where things naturally want to go. We need to understand that our job is to step back and let it happen. We create a loving, safe learning environment and then have faith that people will find their own way to the healing they need. This is somewhat humbling. We are not the healers.</description>

      <description>There is a certain connection magic that always comes up for a group that goes through something intense together. People connect and become one. It is part of being human. We are a deeply social animal and we are meant to form groups both large and small. We even have mirror neurons dedicated to this task. If someone is grieving I grieve too. If someone is in pain I hurt also.</description>

      <description>This is the base. Everything has to be built on top of this. In Hakomi we were taught to build a loving &amp;ldquo;bubble&amp;rdquo; between ourselves and our client. In HAI it comes from the deep love from the facilitators and the team. They are all there because they are deeply committed to love and together they create the same &amp;ldquo;bubble&amp;rdquo; but for an entire room. The very first thing the facilitators do is to model loving, tender connection with each other.</description>
