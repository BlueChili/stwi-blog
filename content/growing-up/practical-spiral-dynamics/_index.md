Before I continue let me first address some questions or points of concern I suspect people might have.

* Spiral Dynamics is not established science

As far as I can tell Spiral Dynamics has not yet been subjected to serious, sustained critical review. The theory is just now gaining attention, so I think getting that review is just a matter of time, but in the meantime we need to be very careful in the claims we make. That is why I am so careful to tie the major stages to well recognized historical epochs. That seems like a solid foundation to build on.

The important thing is to recognize that we need a better explanation than what we have had up to now. And we need something right now. It might turn out that parts of the theory might need to be tweaked, but it gets us going. It provides a much more useful story than we have been telling ourselves.

* There are different interpretations

If you listen to people talk about Spiral Dynamics you will hear important differences in interpretation. Again my approach is to focus on what history teaches us. I don't claim to be a historian, but I have an amateur's passion for the subject. That focus leads me to, for example, a little bit different interpretation of Red and Blue than you might hear from others. It is clear to me that Red coincides roughly with the advent of agriculture and was the cause of empire, and that Blue was a reaction to that ruthless empire. Others might not have even thought about whether the Roman empire was a Red or Blue stage, but I think the difference is crucial.

* It might be better as an explanation of groups than individuals

People are complicated and contain many layers at once. Perhaps at work someone is a dedicated scientist (orange), but at home they find deep solace in their simple, unquestioning Catholicism (blue). How do you put that person into just one Spiral level? I find it seems to work better to focus on group behaviors. Those seem to average out to one level or another. So a science organization is Orange and the Catholic church is Blue.

* It assumes an order

The theory assumes that each level is a reaction to the one before it. So you can't skip levels. Each level is necessary. For example you can't jump straight from Red to Orange. We first needed to wake up to the Truth and community of Blue before we could then break away to the individual liberties of Orange. Orange shares with Red the focus on the individual, but it is still grounded in the law and order truth of Blue. The difference between a Red businessman and a Orange one is that the Orange business man still wants to make money, but feels morally constrained by the law, whereas the Red business man is primarily worried about getting caught. Do you see how both are still focused on individual concerns but the Orange level is higher?

* There are many different levels

A plumber knows way more about plumbing than me, but I know more about programming. Maybe you know more about spirit, but I know more about personal growth. Maybe I am at a higher color level than someone, but that does not make me superior. It just means I can see some things they don't. Imagine a doctor who is struggling in his marriage working together with a tribal shaman to help stop a contagious disease breakout. The shaman will hopefully be wise enough to recogize they should listen to the doctor on how to best combat the disease. The doctor on the other hand, if they are lucky enough, will realize they should listen to the shaman about pretty much everything else. The doctor does see some things more clearly about disease, but that in no way makes them superior to the shaman. There are so many important things to know, the levels are just one of them.

Let me know if you have a question or point of concern that I have not addressed. I will add it here.

OK with that hopefully handled, let's get started. Let's put this theory to practical use. How can does all of this help us save the world?
