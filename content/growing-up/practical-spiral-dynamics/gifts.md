Each level brings a crucial gift. But we can have blindspots here too. For example, Green hates Red and can see nothing useful in the Red mindset whatsoever. And similarily Red hates Green. To be sure, Green is not wrong. We are in fact living in a world of systemic racism and sexism. But what Green (and I have to admit I too) struggle with is to realize there actually is a gift that Red brings. And that gift is crucial. This is too big a project -- we need all the gifts.

## Beige

If you read other writer's descriptions of Beige you will find them dismissing this level as impossibly primitive and best quickly skipped over. They are making a big mistake. I think for most of us this is going to be the most important stage. Healing has to start here.

Imagine you have been hiking mostly alone in the wilderness for months. You are carrying a heavy pack and it hurts. You have lost most of your toenails. And yet day in and day out you keep on going. Why? Because you have a desparate need for healing. A healing that only nature can provide. And then one day you find yourself. This is where it has to start. Nature helps us find our feet. Cheryl Strayed tells an inspirational story of healing herself by hiking 1100 miles of the PCT in her book [Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild:_From_Lost_to_Found_on_the_Pacific_Crest_Trail). This clip is the final scene from the movie adaptation. I think people find her memoir so compelling because on some level they recognize the healing power of simply walking in nature.

I am going to come back to this level over and over. It is the base everything else is built on.

### Gifts

* Profound connection with nature
* Right diet (eating what works best for your particular body)
* Exercise
* Sexual vibrancy
* Touch
* Nurturing family
* Internal knowing

## Purple

We have forgotten what Purple knows. It is now just too weird and harsh for most of us. Whether it is the Australian aboriginal [Dreaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dreaming) or a Lakota [Sun Dance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Dance) where dancers pierce their chests with a rawhide thong so they can dangle from a pole that they spend days dancing around with no food or water, or the wild Spirit world of the Dagara people described by [Malidoma Somé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malidoma_Patrice_Som%C3%A9) it is beyond our modern abilities to understand.

Somé talks about this in his book, [The Healing Power of Africa](https://archive.org/details/healingwisdomofa00mali/mode/2up). He was ripped away from his family in Africa at the age of 4 by missionaries and put in a missionary school. He escaped 16 years later only to find he could no longer even speak the language of his Dagara people. The elders decided he should undergo the dangerous, traditional initiation even though he was now much older than the typical initiate. At first he struggles. He is too western now he thinks. And this is just too hard and weird. But then he has an amazing vist from the Green woman. And his life is changed forever. I read the story from his book [here](https://youtu.be/h_SRgNOzufU).

Purple is where we ultimately need to return to. We will need to revive this ancient wisdom. But this time on a global level. That is what Turqoise basically is.

### Gifts

* Community
* Spirit of place
* Creativity
* Part of something much bigger than yourself
* Wisdom of tribe

## Red

There is a part of us that wants to crush and dominate our enemies. I personally struggle with this, but it is there in me too. So much suffering has come from this stage, and yet it is a part of us. And we so desperately need it. We need Red to save the world. Where else are we going to get the courage to take on this crazy challenge? We can take that same desire to conquer and channel it to something much more useful. We can take the warrior spirit found in many young people (particularly men) and use it to create a world-wide peace keeping force. Because make no mistake the world needs protecting. There will always be some would be dictator who wants to grab for power. It has been that way since the beginning of history, it will not suddenly stop now. The trick will be to embrace this level but not collapse into it. We will need to find the balance between deeply honoring the peace keepers willing to sacrifice their lives, but not get caught up into war hysteria when war comes our way.

Jim Channon, a high level officer in the U.S. Army had a vision of warrior monks who protect the world as it evolve to the next stage:

[First Earth Battalion](https://web.archive.org/web/20110811190649/http://arcturus.org/field_manual.pdf)

He wrote this in 1982 (during the Reagan presidency) so he was very much ahead of his time, but I think he was on to something. Many young people *want* to be warriors. Let's put that to good use because we will need their protection. It will let the youth channel all that aggressiveness into something positive.
