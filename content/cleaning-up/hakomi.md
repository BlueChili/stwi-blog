If you know Hakomi a few of these principles might look new to you. Loving Presence was added [here](https://hakomiinstitute.com/about/hakomi-mindful-somatic-psychotherapy/the-hakomi-principles). Truth and Change were added [here](https://www.hakomica.org/about-hakomi/method-process). This brings us to eight principles which seems like the [right number]({{< relref "/posts/eight.md" >}}) to me.
