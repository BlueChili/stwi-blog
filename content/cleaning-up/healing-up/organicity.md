>I don’t think people are seeking the meaning of life as much as they are seeking the experience of being alive.”
Joseph Campbell

"Organicity" is an unfamiliar, awkward word, and I have to confess I initially resisted it. My partner especially dislikes it but try as we might we can't come up with an alternative. We really do need a new word here. Ignore what the dictionary might say, in this sense the word combines "organism" with "icity" to mean the nature of an organism. It focuses us on the living, natural organisms that we all are. We tend to skip right past that, but this principle brings us back over and over to the miracle of life. Brings us back to noticing what our living body is feeling and longing for. Living things are always healing. Always. Isn't that amazing? A doctor might set a broken bone, but then it is up to the body to do the healing. When a 17 year old girl who I was very close to died I was devasted. A wise grief counselor told me that we are never the same after our losses, but to know that we are always on a path towards healing. I found that incredibly comforting and it felt true.

There might be something blocking us, but health is where we naturally want to go. Hakomi teaches us to step back and let that healing happen. We just help people find where they are blocked and help them get unblocked. The rest is up to to them. For the therapist this is quite humbling. We are not the healers. We are merely the support crew. We have to surrender control -- it is a leap of faith. I struggled with this. It was surprisingly hard to simply ask my client "What wants to happen next?", and to trust that something may come to them or not and either way it was OK. I had this mistaken notion that I needed to constantly direct things. But that is not how healing works -- it always comes from within. Forest bathing guides are taught that it is the forest holds the answers for their participants, they are just opening the door. The forest will provide exactly what is needed in that particular moment. Again every organism  innately knows what is best for it.

Do you remember my story of standing in front of the room struggling to make the commitment to leading a rich, fulfilling, meaningful life? There was that moment when the facilitator asked, "Everyone who believes he deserves this please stand". And everyone stood up. As I stood there sobbing something shifted inside me. I could feel it. Something in me that had been blocked was now flowing. That was a moment of organicity. I was still struggling with what I had to do next, but this internal knowing was driving me forward. Guiding me.

We start by creating the safe space within (non-violence), then we simply get curious (truth), and start to watch ourselves carefully (mindfulness). That leads us to be here right now in our body (mind-body) and next we see what wants to happen next (organicity). We trust that our heart, mind, and body will lead us. And where will they lead us? We don't know, but we do know it will be something maybe very different than what we have right now. It will be a change.
