What happens in our body affects our Mind. What happens in our Mind affects our body. It is all one. And when we have a trauma we store that trauma somewhere in our body. In his book [The body keeps the score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Body_Keeps_the_Score), the psychiatrist  Bessel van der Kolk talks about how when he started working with traumatized people his profession didn't have much to offer. They didn't even really recognize that PTSD was a real thing. That has changed. In the second half of his book he talks about the many, many different and promising therapy options for traumatized people we have now. This is huge. Maybe for the first time since the start of Red empire we have the chance to finally stop that cycle of one generation passing it's trauma on to the next. And as different as these therapy options are they do share one thing -- a way to help people to connect their bodies back into the world.

I worked with a very, very traumatized young woman struggling to recover from extreme childhood PTSD. When she told me her history I would weep with horror -- it was just too much. How could anyone possibly recover from that!? And she suspected that her crippling illnesses were all that trauma still livin on inside her. We used MDMA as sacred medicine and she had an amazingly rich journey. She discovered sacred, holy connection with her body and I wept again but this time tears of joy. Up until then her body had only been a source of pain, something she had to learn to manage and hold off. For as long as she could remember her body never had enough heat and was always cold. Now she had plenty. For over a year after that journey we simply did Hakomi talk therapy and she would find her way back to her body. Simply remembering her sacred journey was all that it usually took. This discovery changed her life. She went from not able to work to working at a Silicon valley startup at a job she loved.

Our society does not handle sex very well. We have a lot of healing to do around this -- sex is yet another way we are disconnected from our bodies. So how do we heal that? HAI workshops is an excellent way. HAI workshops helped me get over much of my sexual shame. But most people won't even consider taking a workshop once they find they are mostly naked. That is such a nonstarter for most people. 

HAI works very hard to get people deeply connected to their bodies. It is one of the major reasons why HAI invites people to take their clothes off. It is why in HAI exercises people spend so much time stroking each other. Our culture has profound dysfunction around sexuality. Many of us have had wounding around our bodies or sex. By releasing some of that shame we can more fully inhabit our bodies.

Medicine work takes us into our bodies in a way most of us have never experienced. Takes us into that wild subconscious that we up to now have only seen glimpses of.
