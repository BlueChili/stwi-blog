When I was in college I went to the Zen center at Green Gulch north of San Francisco to meditate for a week. I knew how rigorous it was going to be so I diligently practiced zazen until I could sit for almost an hour in perfect stillness. I was quite proud of my ability. We sat so quietly that even if someone swallowed you could hear it so I tried to not even do that. Then one morning a woman came in who wasn’t as skilled and she shifted and moved around trying to get comfortable quite a bit. What a racket! But after a few days she settled in and got quieter and quieter until one morning at breakfast she remarked, “I heard the ocean this morning!”. One of the monks replied, “It was always there you just needed to get quiet enough to hear it”. And it was true the ocean waves were always there in the distance but you did have to be quite still to hear them. In the very same way we need to get still enough to hear what is really going on for us. Usually we are too busy shifting around to get comfortable for us to pay attention.

That woman later asked for chocolate chip cookies for dessert. Scandalous!  I thought. What an interesting story I was telling myself. That simple pleasure was not allowed. Fortunately the cooks were wiser than me and obliged. But here is the interesting thing. Have you ever eaten something, super slowly and with exquisite focus? If you try that with a normal chocolate chip cookie your head will explode. They are way, way too sweet and intense for that. They are designed to blast past our normal inattentiveness and grab us by the throat so we can’t help but notice them. What the Zen cooks baked, however, was a cookie that invited you to really deeply pay attention to it. But you had to get quiet enough to appreciate it.
