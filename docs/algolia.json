We were sitting in a grassy courtyard surrounded by the dark-grey University of Chicago walls. Grey, grey minds always peering down at you was how a friend described the walls, but it was sunny and we were sitting on a park bench looking at the surprisingly pretty, purple-grey pigeons hop around on the grass. We had just gotten out of class, and for some reason this brilliant young woman was taking me into her confidence. The class was a small freshman seminar based on the Great books. At the moment we were studying Immanuel Kant, a genius philosopher, who had written a book arguing very persuasively that morality could be explained entirely on the basis of rational, logical rules. He was saying, in other words, that any moral decision can be decided if you just think rationally enough about it. I had found myself persuaded, but this young woman was not, and that is what we were talking about.\nShe thought for a moment, searching for a way to explain herself. I sympathized with her - it was hard to argue against a genius. \u0026amp;ldquo;I know he\u0026amp;rsquo;s wrong because I tried to commit suicide, but I\u0026amp;rsquo;m still alive. I chose to stay alive because I realized that life is good.\u0026amp;rdquo; I looked at her not knowing what to say. This was not the typical University of Chicago conversation. This school, more than most, treasured the clear calmness of pure rationality. It was why a lot of us had chosen the school. What she was saying was emotional and non-rational, and yet it felt incredibly powerful and vibrant. It had the smell of truth. But I also recognized the truth in what Immanuel Kant was saying \u0026amp;ndash; along with all the other philosophers we were reading. How could such conflicting views both seem so right? Something was wrong here, but what? It was the start of my crisis of faith.\nIf I\u0026amp;rsquo;m in a lot of pain, should I commit suicide? \u0026amp;ndash; what a deeply moral question, and yet …","date":1656926775,"description":"","lastmod":"2022-07-04T09:26:15Z","objectID":"7c7920671ab98c63e1c95b45ed82822b","permalink":"https://cosmosgame.github.io/save-the-world/other/my-waking-up/crisis-of-faith/","publishdate":"2022-07-04T09:26:15Z","title":"Crisis of Faith"},{"content":"In my thirties I ended up in a lot of pain. I longed for a release from this pain, and on a subconscious level suicide might even have been starting to look attractive. At least it all would be over then. I tried talk therapy, but was deeply unimpressed with that method, although it seems to have worked for others. Then I stumbled onto some mildly radical personal growth seminars. I absolutely loved them. It turned out that I had some work to do - my mental machinery needed some fixing. The classes revealed to me how much I feared others. I had on a deep level just assumed everyone was out to hurt me. So I experimented with giving myself permission to connect to others on a deeper level and found pure joy! I also found out that many people\u0026amp;rsquo;s struggles were in fact mine as well. And then I started on the hard work of changing the beliefs and assumptions that were getting in the way. I gradually became aware of a voice that was constantly tearing me down and even punishing me. I battled to love myself instead of hate myself. One practice I used was to look in the mirror at my acne-scarred face and say from the heart, \u0026amp;ldquo;I love you\u0026amp;rdquo;. To this day, every time I have a painful, negative thought about myself I habitually remind myself, \u0026amp;ldquo;I have value\u0026amp;rdquo;, and touch my hand to my heart. This may not sound like much, but it has been of enormous help to me. An acquaintance that knew me both before and after I had done this work said that, \u0026amp;ldquo;You look a lot more comfortable in your skin now\u0026amp;rdquo; - that describes it nicely.\nThe work of mental healing was fascinating, and I delved even deeper into it. The more I explored the more I came to realize that the very heart of healing is centered on spirituality. Even worse, I started to recognize and cherish my spiritual self. Oops. As a devout atheist (of course I was!), this was deeply surprising and not a little troubling. Note that I am not talking about \u0026amp;ldquo;God\u0026amp;rdquo;, which is something I still …","date":1656926775,"description":"","lastmod":"2022-07-04T09:26:15Z","objectID":"854fb959a738242d65ec798c8b1fdede","permalink":"https://cosmosgame.github.io/save-the-world/other/my-waking-up/deeper/","publishdate":"2022-07-04T09:26:15Z","title":"Deeper"},{"content":"But I didn\u0026amp;rsquo;t know all this when I was sitting back there on that picnic bench at U. of C. It took a long personal journey before I learned to trust other sources of knowledge other than pure reason. To most people this is hardly a discovery - my wife laughs that I was ever in doubt about it. But, I wish someone would have explained this to me when I was younger. Up until this crisis of faith I had been a strict rationalist; Spock was my role model. In short, I was a nerd. I could literally spend all day wrapped up in abstract though, and I loved every second of it. This wasn’t, unfortunately, something I could share with most people. My high school was an inner-city, working class school. Intellectuals were not well tolerated, and I kept my love of ideas fairly well hidden. But I also lived in another world as well, the world of sports. Once, while I was on the football team, I got tired of waiting for the bus. It seemed like we were always waiting in the pseudo military that was football. One day, throwing caution to the wind, I pulled out a trashy sci-fi book (for some reason I thought it would help that the book was trashy) to read. Friends on the team came over to check in with me sincerely worried that there might be something wrong - they were really, touchingly concerned. The next day the coach accosted my father in the hallway (my father worked as the music supervisor for the district), and said in the bluff joking jock style \u0026amp;ldquo;Do you know what the hell your son was doing the other day?!? He was reading!!, That\u0026amp;rsquo;s what. What the hell has gotten into him!!?\u0026amp;rdquo;. He was half serious. My worst fears were confirmed.\nIt was remarkably like being gay and in the closet. I was too scared to openly declare myself an intellectual, so I kept it hidden. So of course, I took that as my central identity. I longed to be an openly flaming intellectual, and looked for my version of San Francisco. The University of Chicago seemed to fit the bill nicely.

It turns out that any formal reasoning system starts out with basic assumptions (called axioms) and works up from there. No useful logical system can be built without these assumptions, but these assumptions have to be taken on faith - they are outside of the system. So many arguments are pointless because the participants are starting with radically different assumptions. Given how enormously important our assumptions are, it is shocking how unaware we typically are of them. When I talk about our mental machinery this is a major component.\nTraditionally, rationalists start with the assumption that only their rational mind can be trusted as a source of truth. Everything else is fallible. Descartes “Meditations” is a great example of this mindset. The legend is that the philosopher Descartes had a bad cold, and was cooped up in a rustic cabin. His thoughts started to turn a little weird and he came up with this little essay titled “Meditations”. Descartes points out in this essay that when you think carefully about it, you start to realize that there really is no way to know that anything is actually as it seems. You don’t even know what you are seeing is real because just like in the Matrix movie it might turn out that everything is getting fed to you by some malevolent power.\nThe problem, though, as Descartes himself points out is that given this mindset you start to doubt that anything up to and possibly including even yourself is real. Descartes concludes that the only thing he can know for sure is that he is thinking – hence the famous \u0026amp;ldquo;I think therefore I am\u0026amp;rdquo; quote. Note that this is a very different mindset from \u0026amp;ldquo;I have a body therefore I am\u0026amp;rdquo;. Doubting that anything at all in the world except your own mind is real is a pretty weird view on life, and I don\u0026amp;rsquo;t particularly recommend it.

Rationalists that stay safe in only their rational minds are missing out on the full richness of being human. When I try to talk about this with my rationalist friends it is somewhat frustrating - I end up basically saying, yes, pizza is one of my favorite foods too, but there is so much else out there as well, why not do a little more exploring?\nSo what do I know now that I didn\u0026amp;rsquo;t back on that picnic bench at University of Chicago?\nI have learned how to bring up other parts of myself to deal with such a deep crisis as that young lady faced \u0026amp;ndash; this is one case where my rational mind would take a back seat. Simply being alive, even in pain is a good thing that needs celebrating. But almost certainly the core of her problem was self-hate and serious depression. I now know a lot about self-hate, and suicide is the ultimate expression of self-hate. The path back from suicide is learning to love oneself, and that almost inevitably touches upon what I call spirituality. I also know about crushing depression, and the solution is to recognize that it is a whole body problem, and needs a whole body treatment that includes exercise, diet, mood enhancers (like St. John\u0026amp;rsquo;s Wort or even possibly prescription drugs), a change in thinking, and of course spiritual work. It wasn\u0026amp;rsquo;t so much a case that Kant, the genius rationalist philosopher, was wrong, but simply that what he had to say wasn\u0026amp;rsquo;t terribly useful in this case.\nThe reason I felt so conflicted during our conversation was that I had been following a jealous God. Strict rationalists, along with many Christians, believe that they are following the one True faith, and everyone else is just a deluded infidel. But what I didn\u0026amp;rsquo;t know at the time is that it is possible to make deep use of reason without being such a narrow, intolerant fundamentalist. It turns out that there are many paths to Truth, and rationality is just one of them.

I now believe just the opposite - it is our bodies that are the center and everything else, including our rational minds, revolves around the body. The proof for this statement is not in thinking about it rationally, but to instead introspect and remember the states that you have been to, and to at least be open to the possibility of finding other states. But what are these other states that I keep on talking about? Ultimately this is something that you will have to discover in yourself. Here are some of the states that I have directly experienced:\nRunner\u0026amp;rsquo;s High\nI love to run. Our bodies love and need to work. When I run, I quickly slip into a semi-trance and my body just takes over. I typically have wonderful conversations with myself as I run - it is when I\u0026amp;rsquo;m at my strongest. I make my most courageous decisions while I\u0026amp;rsquo;m running - I feel powerful and capable. When I need to make a big decision, I like to go running on it. People who don\u0026amp;rsquo;t believe that this state exists, or doubt that they can achieve it themselves are, by their very disbelief, keeping themselves from achieving this state. Isn\u0026amp;rsquo;t that strange?.\nBerserker rage\nI discovered this state in high school football. I found that if I prepared myself mentally all of the day before a game I could go into a very, very powerful rage/trance during the game. This crazy rage made me a kind of star during my sophomore season. It turns out that we have a war-like, berserker state where we can do incredibly physical feats. The Vikings knew about these states - it is where we get the word \u0026amp;ldquo;berserk\u0026amp;rdquo;. The rage/trance let me perform way beyond my normal athletic limits. On the down side I also smashed through people without being conscious of what harm I was doing to them.

This is a surprisingly deep question, and surprisingly few people ever think much about it. Or then again, perhaps it isn\u0026amp;rsquo;t surprising. Whether we are aware of it or not we all have mental machinery humming along that helps us make the countless choices we need to make. Most of us instinctually recognize that messing with this machinery might cause a person\u0026amp;rsquo;s life to break down. Indeed, I have seen it happen \u0026amp;ndash; people can literally think themselves into craziness. But on the other hand not understanding how we make decisions leaves us helpless to our own machinery. Your unconscious machinery might have problems, and sometimes, like in the case of the young woman choosing to live or die this makes a great deal of difference. If we want to lead a deep, rich fulfilling life it is necessary to make sure that our underlying assumptions (our mechanism) is sound. And one of the key assumptions that we need to examine is how we sort data into knowledge - how do we decide if we believe something is true or not?\nThink about what is going on when you argue with someone. Presumably, we argue with people to get them to see our point of view, and hopefully convert them. Amazingly, it occasionally works, but why? How are they persuaded to change their mind? It turns out we all have an innate sense of logic. This is the basis for our reasoning. You can make a logical argument to me, and if I happen to be in a rational mood I might recognize the truth of your words.\nYou find this truth by turning inward and thinking about it. Some rational part of us just recognizes truth. This is a very powerful faculty – it is how we conquered the planet. Possibly the purest expression of pure reason is mathematics. That discipline is based on proofs. For convenience most of us in school just skipped over the proofs and went straight to using the results, but, in principle, learning Mathematics is a process of self-discovery. …","date":1656926775,"description":"","lastmod":"2022-07-04T09:26:15Z","objectID":"ad32ea9e4573cc744806e0f1ac09daa6","permalink":"https://cosmosgame.github.io/save-the-world/other/my-waking-up/truth/","publishdate":"2022-07-04T09:26:15Z","title":"Truth"},{"content":" “We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.”\nAlbert Einstein.\n Welcome!

But instead just like in Aaron\u0026amp;rsquo;s story the social worker buys into his mom\u0026amp;rsquo;s well practiced lies and steps back and does nothing. Making the situation even worse than it was before. It is almost as if children are their parent\u0026amp;rsquo;s property to do with as they see fit. That is so obviously wrong, and yet I think it is our reality. We, just like that social worker, want to believe the comforting lie that a child is always better off with their mother. But unfortunately quite often that mother was also raised by deeply traumatized parents and so she too is acting out of pain. Not truly wanting to but nevertheless deeply wounding her child. One generation passing its trauma on to the next generation over and over. We need to stop this cycle.\nChildren need advocates outside their families. Every child should have at least one functioning, heart-based adult who advocates for them. At least one, more would be even better. Childcare workers traditionally have been some of the least respected in our society. Notice how little they get paid (if they get paid at all). We have that exactly backwards. The revolutionary vanguard must include preschool and kindergarten teachers. Any council of power has to have them seated at the table.\nThere are, of course, many groups doing great work.

What saved him? Simply a friend\u0026amp;rsquo;s undemanding love. The friend wasn\u0026amp;rsquo;t trying to fix him, he just wanted to spend time with him. Even though Aaron had lied to him and stolen from him, his friend was still there. Love freely given with no expectations. What a beautiful, simple, powerful gift. What would the world look like if more people got the love they needed? Please sit with that thought for a moment. Maybe breathe into it. It really is the core of my plan \u0026amp;ndash; my longing is for us to all get back to here. To that place where we feel loved and are willing to take the scary risk of loving others. Love is not something that just happens to us. It is a verb not a noun \u0026amp;ndash; we are not just waiting around for it to magically appear. Loving others is a disclipine that can be cultivated and strenthened until it is a way of life. Simple enough to say, but quite hard to do at times. For many of us the hardest to learn was the least complicated\nThe Buddhists have a beautiful exercise called Metta, the loving kindness prayer. It starts with sending unconditional love to yourself. Then you send unconditional love to the people that you are closest to and find easiest to love. Then to ones that are maybe a little further out, then further out and more neutral, eventually getting to people you don\u0026amp;rsquo;t love at all. They get included too. Eventually you get to a place of loving absolutely everyone and every thing. This takes work! It is like a muscle that has to be built up.\nWhen I was staring so fearfully into that mirror back at the workshop I was struggling to get to even the very first step of this prayer.

I kept on ignoring and ignoring it for two weeks. Finally it finally got so painful even I could no longer ignore it so I went into urgent care and got a prescription that cleared me up pretty much in one day. Why did I wait so long? Now with the infection gone I realize how much it was weighing on me. I feel so much better now and have so much more energy! It was blocking me from service.\nWe have this weird illusion that somehow our body is different from our mind. As if they are separate things. What a strange story we tell ourselves. It is so not true. What happens in our body affects our mind. What happens in our mind affects our body. This seems so obvious but apparently I still am struggling to learn this.\nWhile my son was going to college I would visit once a month and take him and his girl friend out to dinner. We all love Thai food so we often chose that. One day after an early dinner we came back to their dorm and I had to crash on their couch. My son was concerned and started saying to his girlfriend, “This is not right. Something is really wrong here”. They were talking about me as if I was not there. I wanted to say, “I’m still right here you know!”, but couldn’t quite manage. I was in basically a mini food coma. Finally I was able to get off the couch and forced myself to go on a long walk with them. That rallied me enough so that I could do the two hour drive home. But I had to agree with my son. Something was not right.\nMy body was telling me that it no longer could handle high carb food. It was time for me to listen. Of course I didn’t. Give up my beloved cereal in the morning?! Give up sushi?! No way. I was also about twenty five pounds overweight and, according to the charts, obese. I tried low carb diets as a technical hack to lose weight quickly.

They swelled so big that my skin was pulled painfully tight and made it hard to smile. They were almost as big as ping pong balls \u0026amp;ndash; I am not exaggerating. And when they finally, finally popped tthey left very big, deep, pitted scars. And they kept on coming. I went from one of the cuter boys to one of the ugliest just like that. And in my bewildered pain I made a choice to protect myself. My ugliness made me vulnerable so I decided to do a sort of amputation. To cut off the part of me that cared about how I looked. So I stared into the mirror and told myself over and over \u0026amp;ldquo;You are ugly\u0026amp;rdquo;. I was trying to toughen myself. This got all the way in because it was actually done with loving intent \u0026amp;ndash; I didn\u0026amp;rsquo;t want anyone to be able to hurt me. And I was so sure it needed to be done. That it was the only way to protect myself. But it actually destroyed me. I\u0026amp;rsquo;m not alone. So many of us attack and belittle ourselves. We tell ourselves stories about how unattractive we are, or stupid, or lazy or whatever. And it really hurts. This pain is real and it cripples us. We can\u0026amp;rsquo;t start to heal until we stop this violence within.\nAfter this mirrors terrified me. And for good reason. Looking in them hurt! All I saw in that mirror was someone so ugly no one could possibly love. And yet sometimes I turn and face my fears. It was hard but I was tired of the pain, tired of running away. So I found myself at that Wall workshop staring at myself in a big bathroom mirror. It was all I could do to just stand there and look. I\u0026amp;rsquo;d heard about an exercise where you look at a mirror and say to yourself, \u0026amp;ldquo;I love you\u0026amp;rdquo;.

My partner especially dislikes it but try as we might we can\u0026amp;rsquo;t come up with an alternative. We really do need a new word here. Ignore what the dictionary might say, in this sense the word combines \u0026amp;ldquo;organism\u0026amp;rdquo; with \u0026amp;ldquo;icity\u0026amp;rdquo; to mean the nature of an organism. It focuses us on the living, natural organisms that we all are. We tend to skip right past that, but this principle brings us back over and over to the miracle of life. Brings us back to noticing what our living body is feeling and longing for. Living things are always healing. Always. Isn\u0026amp;rsquo;t that amazing? A doctor might set a broken bone, but then it is up to the body to do the healing. When a 17 year old girl who I was very close to died I was devastated. A wise grief counselor told me that we are never the same after our losses, but to know that we are always on a path towards healing. That felt really good to hear. She was reminding me to trust myself.\nBut quite often something is blocking us. When I stood in front of the room struggling to make the commitment to lead a deep, rich, meaningful life, I was really stuck. The facilitator then asked the group, \u0026amp;ldquo;Everyone who believes he deserves this please stand\u0026amp;rdquo;. And everyone stood. As I stood there sobbing something shifted inside me. I could feel it. Something in me that had been blocked was now flowing. That was a moment of organicity. I was still struggling with what I had to do next, but this internal knowing was driving me forward. Guiding me.\nThis getting unblocked is the core of Hakomi.

I was walking down a long corridor thinking about how I want to keep on doing good things while simultaneously feeling kind of embarrassed and hokey and suddenly the light coming in from the windows got very strong and I was walking into this welcoming, warm light wrapping all around me. Yes. This. I will always step into the light. Always. This is my most precious gift. I will always step towards the light of Truth even if it requires walking over broken glass. I don\u0026amp;rsquo;t know how to teach this to others \u0026amp;ndash; it was kind of just given to me.\nIf we want to heal we have to find our deeper truths. Hakomi gently guides clients deeper and deeper into a non ordinary state of consciousness that helps them get all the way down to their core beliefs. These are the (mostly) unconscious beliefs people have about how the world works. What is and is not safe. These beliefs are usually created by a child desperately trying to survive against unfair odds. So we honor the genius of that child for finding something that worked, but then help them see how that solution also came with a price. A price that now maybe is not worth it. As adults they now have more resources and there are better solutions available. But first maybe they just need to spend some time soothing that hurt child and reassuring them that they are safe now.\nHAI workshops revolve around group shares. People stand up in front of the group (usually stark naked) and are lovingly encouraged to share from the most vulnerable, authentic place they can find within themselves. Quite often people are inspired to stand up after having a breakthrough during one of the exercises. Or maybe they are moved to share their most painful secret. There is something incredibly beautiful about sharing your deepest, naked Truth in front of a circle of sacred witnesses. A circle that holds all of you in love.

If someone is grieving I grieve too. If someone is in pain I hurt also. When someone does some work for themselves they are doing work for me as well. This is one reason why HAI creates so much space for sharing, because we can learn so much from each other. The other reason is that when we are in a safe, deeply connected group like this, people become our sacred witness.

They can be our North star to help guide us when we get lost. They work together. All of them are necessary. If a Hakomi session didn\u0026amp;rsquo;t go well, students are taught to look to the principles to see what was missing. This brings us back to systems thinking. Asking \u0026amp;ldquo;why?\u0026amp;rdquo; to go deeper and deeper so that we can embrace all parts of the system.\nHakomi started with five founding principles. Loving Presence was added here. Truth and Change were added here. This brings us to eight principles which seems like the [right number]({{\u0026amp;lt; relref \u0026amp;ldquo;/posts/eight.md\u0026amp;rdquo; \u0026amp;gt;}}) to me.\nThese principles guide a therapist when working with a client. But they also can guide our lives. We can use them to guide us on how to do our ongoing Healing Up work. We also can use them as a foundation for the life practices of Wising Up. We can even use them for inspiration when finding our way to spirt and soul in our Waking Up work.\nTruth \u0026amp;ldquo;Get curious about that\u0026amp;rdquo;, is a standard Hakomi invitation. Hakomi helps clients find their way to their core truth; their core story. This truth is usually too hard or scary to get to all on our own so we need help. And that is the place where healing can happen. We have to get to the deeper truth of things before we can make a change. We have to know our story before we can change it. Trying to play it safe and stay at the surface does not really work.\nWe should always be on a quest for the deeper truth. Sometimes we need help getting there, sometimes we can get there on our own, but there is always a deeper truth remaining to be found.\nNon violence \u0026amp;ldquo;I welcome that strong protector \u0026amp;ndash; it has kept you safe\u0026amp;rdquo;.

And I saw them work for others. So let\u0026amp;rsquo;s start there.\nIn the sections to come I am going to tell my healing and growth stories. Here I introduce the schools where I did much of this work. Each of these schools has an experiential (Beige) side that has people heal and grow simply by experiencing what the school has to offer. But each school also has a group (Purple) side where you join the community and offer service to the world.\nHakomi Hakomi is a beautiful form of body centered, talk therapy. The question asked over and over again in different ways is \u0026amp;ldquo;Where are you feeling this in your body?\u0026amp;rdquo;. And then you are invited to deepen into that. It is the only form of talk therapy that has ever worked for me. A typical Hakomi sessions takes the client way, way deep into themselves. They enter a liminal state of here and now. Here in their body, deep into all their hidden parts. To get there the client has to know how safe and welcomed all parts of them are. How even those pesky defenses they have are welcomed and celebrated. And it is at these deeper layers that we find where we formed our core beliefs, our core stories, and now we have the choice to choose a new story.\nAfter you have done some healing work, some people feel called to service. To learn how to provide this amazing healing service to others. The Hakomi Institute offers many classes and they are open to everyone. They range from one day workshops to a two year program. I did the two year program. Each year we had ten three day weekends. Those weekends felt like a personal growth weekend to me.

Let’s now go deeper and talk about what happens when we have trauma. When we suffer a traumatic event we store that trauma somewhere in our body. When Bessel van der Kolk, author of The Body Keeps the Score, first started out as a psychiatrist his profession didn\u0026amp;rsquo;t have much to offer traumatized people. They didn\u0026amp;rsquo;t even really recognize PTSD as a thing. That has changed. In the second half of his book he describes the many, many different, promising therapy options for traumatized people we have now. This is huge. Maybe for the first time since the start of Red empire we have the chance to finally stop the cycle of one generation passing it\u0026amp;rsquo;s trauma on to the next. And as different as all these therapy options are they do share one thing \u0026amp;ndash; they help people connect their bodies back into the world.\nI worked with a very, very traumatized young woman struggling to recover from extreme childhood PTSD. When she told me her history I would weep with horror \u0026amp;ndash; it was just too much. How could anyone possibly recover from that!? She suspected her crippling illnesses were all that trauma still living on inside her body. We used MDMA as sacred medicine and she had an amazingly rich journey. She discovered a nurturing, holy connection with her body and her face glowed with joy. Up until then her body had only been a source of pain, something she had to learn to manage and hold off. Her body never had enough heat and was always cold. Now she had plenty of heat. For over a year after that journey our Hakomi sessions had her finding her way back to her body. Simply remembering her sacred journey was all that it usually took. It profoundly changed her life. She still had her medical challenges, but now she was able to step into the world in a much bigger way. It starts with the body.\nAnd then there is sex. Our society does not handle sex very well.

For example, Mark Manson has an excellent article [here]. He writes in his vivid way of all the amazing benefits both health-wise and mental. But in that article he lightly touches upon something that is often overlooked. We tend to think of meditation as the only way to cultivate mindfulness. It is not. Meditation is not the answer to all our problems. In fact, [too much meditation] can lead to [spiritual emergencies] that without proper help can crush someone or even lead them to suicide. Don\u0026amp;rsquo;t get me wrong \u0026amp;ndash; I love meditation. I meditate daily in front of my beloved altar and it has helped me a lot. It is just that I have seen too many people take up meditation as The One True Way, when it is just one of the ways, and not even a complete way at that.\nHakomi\u0026amp;rsquo;s way is to simply bring more awareness to what is going on. Clients are constantly coached to pay attention to the moment. To really notice what is going on with their bodies and to just get curious. To recognize our internal voice that is always talking and to realize it is just one voice telling a story that is not necessarily true. The therapist acts as a support to help lean into the things that are hurting. The therapist first checks to see if it is OK to proceed (non-violence principle) and then maybe asks the client to breathe into the pain. Asks in different ways to get curious about whatever is happening in the moment (truth principle). And just like yoga starts off awkward and stumbling but eventually becomes much more smooth, if you do this kind of inquiry enough you start to develop the habit of mindfulness. You start to notice what is happening even without the therapist directing you.\nBuddhists refer to this process as RAIN. I particularly like [Tara Brach\u0026amp;rsquo;s] version of it.

In World War II most of the world had collapsed into authoritarian Red. The only thing that saved us was armed conflict; nothing else would do against Hitler and Tojo. Unbelievable numbers of people died in the resistance but it was sadly necessary. What we forget is that most of the people we were fighting, the Germans, the Japanese, believed that they too were doing the hard but necessary thing. They also were dying for something they believed in. When it gets this bad we have no choice but to fight. But our goal is to create a world where it doesn\u0026amp;rsquo;t get that bad.

As soon as you set up a hierarchy people naturally want to be right at the top. I thought this didn\u0026amp;rsquo;t apply to me until someone dismissed me as merely Green. I was so upset! How dare they! Then I caught myself \u0026amp;ndash; oops. Me too. But remember no stage is better than another. All the stages have deep wisdom, and we want to welcome all they have to offer. To get to where we want we will need all of the stages working together. Truly. But we are human and so we will find ourselves going to that place of feeling superior. Just know that you will, catch yourself (with compassion) and then find your way back.\nSpiral Dynamics is not established science As far as I can tell Spiral Dynamics has not yet been subjected to serious, sustained scientific review. The theory is just now gaining attention, so I think getting that review is just a matter of time, but in the meantime we need to be very careful in the claims we make. That is why I am so careful to tie the major stages to well recognized historical periods. That seems like a solid foundation to build on. I have done a lot of historical research to make sure what I say is accurate and I will correct any errors people find. But more than a theory I think we need a story that explains how we got here. Spiral Dynamics does that well.\nThere are different interpretations If you listen to people talk about Spiral Dynamics you will hear important differences in interpretation. Again my approach is to focus on what history teaches us. I don\u0026amp;rsquo;t claim to be a historian, but I have an amateur\u0026amp;rsquo;s passion for the subject. That focus leads me to, for example, a different interpretation of Red and Blue than you might hear from others.

But this is true for everyone. We all can not see our own blind spots by definition! Other people can know things, can be so more advanced than us on something that we don\u0026amp;rsquo;t recognize how much further ahead they are. So when we reach an impasse with someone, it is important to stop and hold open the possibility that maybe, just maybe this might be our blindspot not theirs.

For the first time in history there was a school teacher onboard, Christa McAuliffe. The networks were televising a special classroom set up for her students watching the launch. 73 seconds after launch the shuttle blew up and her students watched her die on national TV. It was a horrible, painful death. It did not have to happen. NASA engineers the day before the launch literally begged for the launch to be cancelled. But the launch had already been postponed numerous times, and if it were postponed yet again it could not be included in Reagan\u0026amp;rsquo;s state of the union address. So the engineers were overruled. But they knew. One of the engineers, Bob Ebeling, told his wife the night before, \u0026amp;ldquo;It is going to blow up\u0026amp;rdquo;\nWhat happened here?

You know to be true what is right in front of you. You are willing to die for your family. There are a surprisingly large number of people buying missile silos to convert them into survival shelters. That is very Beige level thinking. By the way, I don\u0026amp;rsquo;t think they are necessarily wrong. If I had a lot of excess money, I would seriously consider doing something like that too. Family is where we start.\nThe whole point of backpacking is to get to this level. That is why people do it for extended periods of time. It takes a while to get back into this easy communion with nature. After you have gone a few days on the trail, the city mentality starts to finally fade away and we can finally just let ourselves be one with the world. It is a very beautiful mental place to get to. So if you find a backpacker on a long hike they are probably in that moment at Beige. The energy field of these people feels very clean and whole.\nThis is also the stage people collapse back to if they have a lot of unresolved trauma and/or pain. All they can manage is just to survive day to day. We all go here when we have a bad flu. Unfortunately some people spend most of their lives in so much pain that they spend much of their life at this stage.

Cheryl Strayed tells an inspirational story of healing herself by hiking 1100 miles of the PCT in her book Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail.

But how does it help us? How do we work more skillfully with all the stages? Let\u0026amp;rsquo;s take one more spin through all the stages to consider what needs to be done.\nBeige So many people are collapsed down to the survival level. They are leading quiet lives of desperation. Just barely able to make it each day. Sometimes this is because they are brutally poor. Sometimes because they are refugees of famine or war. And in the U.S an unbelievably high number of people are trauma victims. People are so traumatized that they can barely lead their lives. This is common! We have to stop this. We should spend at least as much money on defense of our children as we do on military defense. We are all wounded and this collective pain is holding us back. We must heal first. And we do that by finding our way back to our bodies and the land.\nPurple Very few people are at authentic Purple. We have done much too good a job of conquering the world to let them survive. So our goal here is to simply learn. Purple has a lot to teach us. In fact it already has. Native American (Purple) intellectuals had a huge affect on American society. Feeling skeptical about that? Please read this book: The Dawn of Everything. An anthropologist and archaeologist teamed up to do the careful, painstaking scholarship needed to completely upend the existing myths about early societies. It turns out that Purple societies lived in large egalitarian cities for thousands of years. They used clever, sustainable agriculture that did not require excessive amounts of labor. And they knew all about Red, and consciously chose systems of government to prevent the empire of Red from arising. They had learned from hard experience what was necessary to lead free and full lives. This is what the Native American intellectuals had to teach the settlers.

Just like one of those Zombie apocalypse everyone else is just a monster to be dealt with. It doesn\u0026amp;rsquo;t matter what happens to those other because they are not really human. Given a chance they would suck out our brains so we have to fight back with everything we have.\nThere is an enormous selfishness that can show up at this level. An incredible indifference to the pain of others. A lot of the world spends at least part of the time here. It doesn\u0026amp;rsquo;t matter how much money you have, if you spend your life in constant fear you are living in survival mode.

This is a driving need. If people can\u0026amp;rsquo;t find a healthy way to express this need they will make do with an unhealthy way. Somehow, some way this need must be met. We are seeing a world wide resurgence of ethnic nationalism \u0026amp;ndash; which is an unhealthy expression of this tribal hunger. It explains some (but not all) of the attraction to Trump. His rallies were a potent drug. People felt part of a tribal whole and they were desperately missing that. How do we counter this? I will talk about deeper solutions in later sections, but possibly the simplest intervention is to get people to switch to a healthier tribe.

I started here because without a coherent story we are stumbling around blind. Blue religions tell us to just trust God and everything will be fine. It won\u0026amp;rsquo;t be. Orange scientists understand global warming but not people. Green activists understand the deep injustices of the world, but not how to fix it. Not really. Yellow seekers see no alternative but to watch the world burn. It doesn\u0026amp;rsquo;t occur to them to join with others. So we have to waken Turquoise but even that is not enough.

Cleaning Up, Waking Up, Showing Up, and Wising Up.\nCleaning Up gives us a deep rich fulfilling life. Beige and Purple will lead us there. Beige guides us back to our bodies. Guides us to our connection with nature and our sexuality. Here we work with our trauma and wounds. This is the Healing Up part of Cleaning Up.

He later on modified it to reflect his focus on individual, spiritual growth which is a different focus.

Thinking animals, yes, but always and forever animals. Here we revel in the delights of our bodies and feel at one with our world. This is what I strive to return to when I go backpacking.

Animals like deers, instinctively know that when something traumatic happens, like getting chased by a mountain lion, they have to take a moment and shake it off.

Whoever had the most power and authority determined what Truth was. Now Truth is recognized as eternal and one.\nGod is one path to this Truth, but not the only way. Buddha woke up under a Bodhi tree just as himself, not a god. He taught a practical path to enlightenment that anyone willing to do the work can follow. Plato based his work on the very Blue notion that the world is just a shadowy reflection of the ideal. The Greeks had no shortage of eloquent smart thinkers, but when those thinkers only focused on selfish, individual ends they just ended up with sophistry. Nothing useful could be built on that. Plato and Aristotle gave the world a glimpse of what is possible when you base your ideas on the foundation of Truth.

Christianity has a lot to answer for, but consider what happened at the very, very beginning of this religion.

They considered themselves the good guys. And you have to kind of marvel at their martial excellence.\nThere is a real darkness here. Brutal wars of conquest swept across the world. The worship of the Goddess was suppressed and women became property. Slavery took root and flourished. Wealth and power went to the very top. People were forced into a brutal form of agriculture that put them into early graves. Much of the suffering of the world still comes from this stage of thinking. This is not how we want to live, but there is no turning back. Much as we might like to go back to Purple we have no choice. We have way too many people on this planet now to sustain a traditional Purple lifestyle. It is like when Cortes landed on the shores of Mexico determined to conquer the Aztec empire. He scouted the coasts for a bit then determined he had to head inland. So he did something very Red; he scuttled his ships.

And it hurts. Really hurts. The world is suffering in so many needless ways. We have met this pain before and run away, but this time we suddenly realize how truly big we are. We are more than just our narrow individual ego. We are part of something so so much bigger. Big enough even to face that scary tidal wave of world pain. We are all one. When you suffer, I suffer too. We now start to really get that. And it is so not OK what is happening. The deeper joy is the joy of all not just the one. From our place of strength we look up and out. And a wild, crazy hope emerges. On our own there is relatively little we can do. But together? Together we can change the world.\nTurquoise as a societal construct is not yet here. There is no history I can point to. So we don\u0026amp;rsquo;t really know yet exactly what Turquoise is going to look like. But we do have the pattern of what has happened up to now to give us some important clues. We know that this stage will be the (tock) return to community. And just like Yellow revisits Beige at a higher stage, Turquoise revisits Purple. We will know Turquoise has arrived by its awesome, legendary parties. Burning Man might be an early yearning towards this. Just like Purple was the start of religion, Turquoise almost certainly will see the rebirth of an enlightened form of religion. It will be a practice of spirit that deeply nourishes and strengthens. And we will become bad-asses once more.\nTurquoise is like a prophecy in a story. It is a dream of what we hope and pray will come. And it can be our intention. Our guide of what needs to happen in order for the world to flourish. But even though Turquoise is not yet fully here I do see some signs of it starting to emerge.

Green by itself won\u0026amp;rsquo;t heal the world. People insist on going their own selfish ways no matter how patiently we explain to them how stupid and evil they are. Then we try a little louder and slower, like you might to someone who does not speak English well. You. are. stupid. And. Evil! Huh. How can they not understand that?!? Why don\u0026amp;rsquo;t they understand how stupid and evil they are?!? Maybe we are missing something? Perhaps there is a deeper stage to go here? Maybe just maybe there is something more workable than dividing the world up into good and evil? But to convince you of that I need for you to go very deeply into yourself. Kind of like an odyssey of the soul. It can be a bit scary and painful, but there is also wonder and joy.

When atoms combine into molecules they want to have exactly eight electrons in their outermost valence shell. Chemistry is based on this. It defines what atoms can join with what other atoms. So for example carbon atoms have 4 electrons in their outer valence shell. So a simple combination is to put two carbon atoms together to form a total of eight. I\u0026amp;rsquo;m simplifying a bit, it turns out that two in the outer valence shell works as well, but that is not possible for most combinations\nUpper limit to short term memory Our short term memory seems to only hold 5 to 9 things at a time. So if we are coming up with a list that we want people to hold in their heads, eight (or at the very most nine) is the maximum.\nLucky number in China The Chinese hold eight as the luckiest number. They traditionally tended to group all of their important things in eights. So they have eight astrology signs, eight imperial ministers, eight cardinal points, etc. Our western minds are quick to scoff at this, but China has a long, rich lived history that deserves respect.\nNotes in a scale A musical scale has eight notes. When you go up or down by eight notes, the notes somehow sound exactly the same, just at a different octave.\nSweet spot for sleep Eight hours seems to be the sweet spot for hours of sleep\nEight Hakomi Principles Hakomi started with 5 principles, but now (depending on who you ask) is up to 8. I think adding the extra 3 principles really made the list complete. I am very happy about this \u0026amp;ndash; I always thought there were a few missing principles (eg. Loving presence) and now it feels just right to me.\nSpiral Dynamics Spiral Dynamics has 8 levels. Note that just like in chemistry the levels we most want to go to are 2 (Purple) and 8 (Turquoise).\nSo what does all this mean?

It is the core belief of the various New Thought religions such as the Centers for Spiritual Living (CSL) . The truth of these words live in my full body not just my head. Back when I was still an atheist I spent many Sundays in CSL church standing in witness to the music and crying as I awoke to this deeper truth. The words started me on the journey but the music they played at church is what got me there. Everything is God. Including me. Including you. Seriously, no-kidding everything.\nEverything means everything I\u0026amp;rsquo;m always a little surprised when I tell people this belief and they just nod and don\u0026amp;rsquo;t push back. There is an awful lot packed into just this one sentence! Following it fully can be quite challenging. Let me give you some examples\nLove your ego I see people arguing earnestly about how important it is to get rid of your ego. I find that alarming. Our ego is an important part of us and it serves us. It is there for a reason. The key is to notice how attached we can get to it and the suffering that can happen when we do. As an aside I confess it is deeply amusing to see people attack the ego in what (at least to me) seems like such an ego-full way.\nLove all the faces of God. Whether you spend two years in a forest monastery or spend two years learning Quantum dynamics in both cases you are devoting yourself to loving one of the faces of God. There are many paths. The way I found my way to spirit was to reassure my rational mind I would never forsake it. It too had an honored path to Truth. It is hard sometimes because I live in two worlds. I live with the Rationalists who don\u0026amp;rsquo;t fully get Spirit. And I live with the Spirit people who quite often don\u0026amp;rsquo;t get Reason and science and don\u0026amp;rsquo;t seem to respect them. There are so many paths to Truth!

Join us for our first \u0026amp;ldquo;comfy\u0026amp;rdquo; backpacking trip. Experience the magical connection with nature that backpackers get without the need to actually carry a backpack and provisions.\nHow is this possible??\nEach day you get to hike from one campground to the next. Our truck and trailer will transport the gear. At the next camp site your tent and hot meals await you. The hikes each day will last about 6 hours if you are hiking at a moderate pace including time for lunch. On flat stretches they will average 10 miles. On days with elevation gain they are no longer than 6 miles (but you can go longer if you want). On most days there are options for shorter hikes, and you can always ride in the truck if your body is ready for a day off.\nWe have planned a seven day journey into nature starting at the southern tip of the PCT (at the Mexican border). We have found it takes a few days to disconnect from the everyday world and to let yourself really immerse in nature. To accomplish this, we ask that you plan to stay with the group for the whole week. We also ask that you minimize use of cell phones to help keep you in the backpacker\u0026amp;rsquo;s mindset.\nEach afternoon Odysseus will also lead a walk to experience “forest bathing”. This custom originated in Japan and encourages us to use all our senses on a slow walk with stops to appreciate our surroundings.\nYour cost is only the actual cost for camping, supplies and gas. Cost: ~$200 (depending on number of people, max 10) plus your cost to get to and from San Diego. We will provide airport pickup as needed.\nBackpacking without carrying a backpack? Why not!\nDates Saturday, April 16th 2022 - Sunday April 24th 2022\nContact us! Interested but have questions? Ready to sign up?

From the very first weekend of my Hakomi trainings we were taught to create a loving bubble with our client. If we could not find a way to love them it was suggested they should maybe not even be our client. So clearly Hakomi is grounded first and foremost in Love but it was not yet one of the principles. Which made no sense. I made a point of privately asking every teacher why Love was not one of the principles and every one of them kind of blinked in surprise and said \u0026amp;ndash; it should be! They couldn\u0026amp;rsquo;t really explain why it wasn\u0026amp;rsquo;t, but I think I know. It turns out that I am not the only one who thought that if you caress someone\u0026amp;rsquo;s face and look deeply into their eyes that that means sex has to happen next. Therapists are taught to hold a certain separation from their client and to expect their clients to project all sorts of things onto them. Therapists fear that they will break down and maybe take advantage of their client\u0026amp;rsquo;s hunger for love and validation. It happens all too often.\nDifferent healing paths So how do we teach people to find their pbody? It has to be experiential. People need to experience it in their bodies to truly understand it. But it won\u0026amp;rsquo;t be just one method. Different approaches will work best for different people. For example, HAI does a fantastic job of getting people in intimate relationship with their body, but for many people getting naked in front of a group of strangers is just a non-starter. There is simply no way they are going to sign up for that. Similarly a sacred MDMA or mushroom journey can offer incredibly healing, but again for many people that kind of journey is way too scary. So we have to meet people where they are at. We will have to make sure that for each person we find things that helps them with diet, movement, sex, and substance abuse.

But they are not well known and definitely not best sellers. Why is that? Why don\u0026amp;rsquo;t we have even one well known plan to save the world? Partly because it is just too overwhelming. We are all stuck in the trance of helplessness. Our shared story is still way too small. But another part is that most of us don\u0026amp;rsquo;t have much experience working with complex systems. Some people do though \u0026amp;ndash; programmers. We have to. No one every formally taught me how to manage complex systems, but out of necessity I learned it over time. I learned that any problem at its heart is because people are far from perfect and you have to figure out how to compensate for our human weaknesses. It turns out that is true of all our problems, not just computer ones. Later on I discovered there is a name for this kind of thinking. It is called Systems Thinking. It recognizes that when you are dealing with the \u0026amp;ldquo;wicked problems\u0026amp;rdquo; of the world you first have to understand the whole system. The temptation is to just pick a part of the problem and get to work because the need is so urgent, but that ultimately has limits. It can help, but it will not get us all the way where we want. We need to go deeper. We need to teach people this style of thinking. It is the only thing that works. So how do does this method work? Let me give some examples.\nFind the root cause I truly hate getting woken up at 3am to solve a service outage. I especially don\u0026amp;rsquo;t like having to report to senior management why I personally cost the company many hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost revenue. And yet this has happened to me.

Programmers kind of just know how it works but let me try and make the underlying principles clear here. The goal is to come up with guidelines that we can fall back on when we are trying to decide what goes in and what stays out. Something that guides us as we write and review. If you find that some part of this site does not match these guidelines please let me know - it is a bug that needs to be fixed.\nSimplicity I deeply value your time. I promise not to waste it. There is a lot to cover here, but I will only bring in the most important points. There are lots of fun tangents that can be visited as side topics, but the goal is to focus on finding the simplest thing that can work. Every idea will be expressed as simply and clearly as possible. If you don\u0026amp;rsquo;t understand a concept it is my fault not yours. Let me know. If you think I\u0026amp;rsquo;m wasting time on something, then you might have found an important bug (or at the very least I am not explaining well enough why it is essential).\nPractical The goal is to create something practical. Something that can actually change the world. Getting the theory right is incredibly important, but on the main path we don\u0026amp;rsquo;t want to bring in any more theory than is strictly necessary. People like myself can go off and do the readings, but then we need to come back here ready to share the useful nuggets that can be put to work.\nWe will know this project is working when we see it inspire actual healing and growth in the world.\nKaizen Kaizen means constant on-going improvement. It is always possible to grow and learn. You should be a bit skeptical of initial versions of this site, but over time as more people contribute and comment the site will grow and mature.

It is kind of a big deal. I\u0026amp;rsquo;ve been watching it with fascination from the beginning. In the 1990\u0026amp;rsquo;s it was not at all clear that it would end up completely conquering the world, but it did. Much of the software that you are using at this very moment is open source. It is built into the very foundations of the internet. Open Source out competed fierce capitalistic companies because it is a better way of collaborating. It is the only instance that I know of where communism won. No one owns open source software; people freely donate their time to it as a gift to the world. Ideas work best when they are free. And frameworks work best when many people have taken a serious look at them and offered improvements. But despite this idealism open source exists to be of use. Not all contributions are accepted. It is not like the wikipedia where there are endless, wasteful edit wars over controversial topics. Open source tends to avoid all that and stays focused on delivering value. And if it doesn\u0026amp;rsquo;t, some other open source project comes along to replace it.\nOpen source does not have to be just for software. I propose that this plan to save the world should be an open source project. So how does that work? This website is hosted on Github, which is where many open source projects live. Every aspect of this site is open to inspection and review. Github supports this kind of collaboration through an intuitive interface. The Github UI is meant to be accessible even to people who are not strongly technical.\nThere are three main ways to interact with this site\nComments Please, please leave a comment below.

What does the plan look like?\nThe Goal First we need to be clear on where we are going. What do we truly want for this world? What would light us up all the way? I suggested earlier that we don\u0026amp;rsquo;t have to over think this. Let our love for our children guide us. Let our inner child guide us. We already know what we dream for the world, we just have to dare to believe it is possible. On some beautiful day the world is going to wake up in love and joy. But we can\u0026amp;rsquo;t just jump straight there from where we are now. This is where the work is.\nIntegral Theory The first step is getting our stories straight. The stories we have been telling ourself up to now have not been serving us. They have been keeping us helpless and isolated. We need to find a bigger story that brings us together. A story that gives us solid ground to stand on. Fortunately, I think much of this work has already been done. Ken Wilber is a brilliant philosopher who had the insight that it is more than past time to integrate all the different worlds of human experience into one integrated theory. Western philosophy, Eastern philosophy, Empiricism, Spirituality, Buddhism, and everything else all brought together as one. This theory is called Integral Theory. I find that it is a great foundation to build upon. It explains a lot of things well.\nThis is his beautifully succinct summary of the work we all need to do:\n Growing Up Cleaning Up Waking Up Showing Up  I add on one more:\n Wising Up  Growing Up Before we can change the world we have to really understand and model the vastly different ways people look at the world. We are missing a map to help us chart our way. We need to go deeper than just assuming that everyone thinks about things pretty much like we do. They don\u0026amp;rsquo;t. Not even close in fact. And yet some how, some way we need to convince people to open their hearts wider and wider. How do we do that?

I am just this nobody on the internet. I don\u0026amp;rsquo;t have any particular expertise or credentials. There is no particular reason you should listen to me other than maybe I can get you to think. But in some ways this ordinariness is actually an advantage. It is so obvious I can\u0026amp;rsquo;t do this alone. We are going to have to do this together\nTo give this any chance of working I can\u0026amp;rsquo;t hold anything back. I need to bring in everything that I am. Not just the shiny parts I want to show to you, but all of my rage, sorrow and pain too. Not just the gifts that I have, but the broken hurting places too. All of me is sacred and holy. All is welcome and loved. And all by myself I am nothing. I have to somehow inspire you to bring in all of yourself. All of your joy and all of your pain. All of you is sacred and holy. All of you is welcome and loved. And together as we look out at the world we need to find a way to bring everyone, yes truly everyone into it. How could it be otherwise? We need all of us.\nWe all have our unique stories. The stories that have shaped us. The stories that are our gift to the world. Let\u0026amp;rsquo;s start with mine.\nExplorer My driving trait seems to be curiosity. I always, always want to dig deeper into the Truth of things. Especially if it is hard. The greatest gift you can give me is to help me see a truth I have been hiding from myself. This is where I started. This drive to explore has taken me to many amazing places, most of them internal.\nMy purpose is to climb tall mountains and leap into worlds unknown to chart the course for others to follow. Let me unpack that a little. I\u0026amp;rsquo;m attracted to things that are challenging and hard. The hard work of climbing a mountain is more than worth it for the view. And again I\u0026amp;rsquo;m talking mostly about internal challenges. Then when you finally get to the top of the mountain you now have a choice.

It kept me sane. I didn\u0026amp;rsquo;t really time myself \u0026amp;ndash; I just ran as hard as I could. But suddenly I was no longer able to run so hard. Heck I was even starting to have problems just walking. I was also having to pee all the time. My neck hurt. My HMO doctor, trying to save money for the corporation, quickly dismissed the problem as sitting with poor posture at my computer and sent me to a physical therapist. Which was complete nonsense. I still had excellent posture from my early Zen practice, and besides I really was in pain. Fortunately the physical therapist was competent and quickly recognized that something was very wrong and managed to get me into the then very expensive MRI lab. They put me in this very narrow tube and scanned me for a long time. The scanning technician was astonished at how happy I was when they told me they had found a tumor. I was just so happy that we finally were getting to the truth of the matter.\nThe tumor was taking over the c4 bone in my spine and if we did not take it out it was going to kill me. They were going to have to remove all the nerves coming out of the left side of the c4 plus a lot of the bone. That meant I was likely to lose a lot of functionality in my left arm. I really didn’t want to lose the ability to raise my arm. One doctor told me it was hopeless. A test book case of what happens when you remove so many nerves. Another, wiser doctor told me to not give up hope. that the body will try very hard to find a way. My brother-in-law is a doctor and researched this particular kind of tumor to see how serious it was. I found out later he told my parents the prognosis was not good so they were all very worried.

But it is what we have to do. We can stay blocked for years and years, but organicity is always striving towards health and eventually something has to give. Let me give an example.\nI was in Guatemala with my ex-wife for a month and midway through my testosterone prescription ran out. I couldn\u0026amp;rsquo;t get a refill but it turns out that Guatemalan pharmacies will sell you pretty much anything they have without the need for a prescription. And they had this high quality testosterone made in Switzerland. Apparently you did just one injection and then you were good for a couple of months. That sounded pretty good \u0026amp;ndash; the daily cream application was a hassle. So I had my ex inject me one night and we went to bed. I woke up in the early hours of the morning and I knew everything had to change. Everything. My ex suffered from extreme anxiety and she constantly was hit with crippling migraines that would keep her in bed for days. She felt a desperate need to control the world because it felt like her very survival was at stake. We had fallen into a bad pattern where she pretty much controlled everything about our lives. Even in the bedroom she would control moment to moment what happened during the infrequent times we were sexual. I went along with all this because I loved her and wanted to help, but it didn\u0026amp;rsquo;t work for either of us.\nI got up and took a long walk. I passed through the early morning markets the Guatemalans have way before they set up for the tourists and all the while I had this strong knowing that everything had to change. What that meant was I stopped letting my ex control everything. That led to a lot of heated arguments. If I had to do it again I would find a gentler way. From her perspective I became a different person over night. It is true I was on way too high a dose of testosterone and that was not good.
