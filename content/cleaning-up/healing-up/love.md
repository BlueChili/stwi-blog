> “People will only protect what they love.”
 Jacques Coustea

In my early thirties I started to lose the ability to run. I was working at a very stressful job at Microsoft back in its glory days and my daily long, hard run was my lifeline. It kept me sane. And I was no longer able to run so hard. Heck I was even starting to have problems just walking. I was also having to pee all the time. I hurt. My HMO doctor obviously trying to save money for the corporation quickly dismissed the problem as sitting with poor posture at my computer and sent me to a physical therapist. Which was complete nonsense. I still had excellent posture from my early Zen practice, and besides I really was in pain. Fortunately the physical therapist was competent and quickly recognized that something was very wrong and managed to get me into the then very expensive MRI lab. They put me in this narrow tube and scanned me for a long time. The scanning technician was astonished at how happy I was when they told me they had found a tumor. I was just so happy that we now knew what was going on and that there was a reasonably good chance we could address it.
