<p>Each stage brings a crucial gift. But we can have blindspots here too. For example, Green hates Red and can see nothing useful in the Red mindset whatsoever. And similarily Red hates Green. To be sure, Green is not wrong. We are in fact living in a world of systemic racism and sexism. But what Green (and I have to admit I too) struggle with is to realize there actually is a gift that Red brings. And that gift is crucial. This is too big a project &ndash; we need all the gifts.</p>
<h2 id="beige">Beige</h2>
<p>If you read other writer&rsquo;s descriptions of Beige you will find them dismissing this stage as impossibly primitive and best quickly skipped over. They are making a big mistake. I think for most of us this is going to be the most important stage. Healing has to start here.</p>
<p>Imagine you have been hiking mostly alone in the wilderness for months. You are carrying a heavy pack and it hurts. You have lost most of your toenails. And yet day in and day out you keep on going. Why? Because you have a desparate need for healing. A healing that only nature can provide. And then one day you find yourself. This is where it has to start. Nature helps us find our feet. Cheryl Strayed tells an inspirational story of healing herself by hiking 1100 miles of the PCT in her book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild:_From_Lost_to_Found_on_the_Pacific_Crest_Trail">Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail</a>. This clip is the final scene from the movie adaptation. I think people find her memoir so compelling because on some stage they recognize the healing power of simply walking in nature.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m41mZZSk1UE">Wild Ending Scene</a></p>
<p>I am going to come back to this stage over and over. It is the base everything else is built on.</p>
<h3 id="gifts">Gifts</h3>
<ul>
<li>Profound connection with nature</li>
<li>Right diet (eating what works best for your particular body)</li>
<li>Exercise</li>
<li>Sexual vibrancy</li>
<li>Touch</li>
<li>Nurturing family</li>
<li>Internal knowing</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="purple">Purple</h2>
<p>We have forgotten what Purple knows. It is now just too weird and harsh for most of us. Whether it is the Australian aboriginal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dreaming">Dreaming</a> or a Lakota <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Dance">Sun Dance</a> where dancers pierce their chests with a rawhide thong so they can dangle from a pole that they spend days dancing around with no food or water, or the wild Spirit world of the Dagara people described by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malidoma_Patrice_Som%C3%A9">Malidoma Somé</a> it is beyond our modern abilities to understand.</p>
<p>Somé talks about this in his book, <a href="https://archive.org/details/healingwisdomofa00mali/mode/2up">The Healing Power of Africa</a>. He was ripped away from his family in Africa at the age of 4 by missionaries and put in a missionary school. He escaped 16 years later only to find he could no longer even speak the language of his Dagara people. The elders decided he should undergo the dangerous, traditional initiation even though he was now much older than the typical initiate. At first he struggles. He is too western now he thinks. And this is just too hard and weird. But then he has an amazing vist from the Green woman. And his life is changed forever. I read the story from his book <a href="https://youtu.be/h_SRgNOzufU">here</a>.</p>
<p>Purple is where we ultimately need to return to. We will need to revive this ancient wisdom. But this time on a global stage. That is what Turqoise basically is.</p>
<h3 id="gifts-1">Gifts</h3>
<ul>
<li>Community</li>
<li>Spirit of place</li>
<li>Creativity</li>
<li>Part of something much bigger than yourself</li>
<li>Wisdom of tribe</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="red">Red</h2>
<p>There is a part of us that wants to crush and dominate our enemies. I personally struggle with this, but it is there in me too. So much suffering has come from this stage, and yet it is a part of us. And we so desperately need it. We need Red to save the world. Where else are we going to get the courage to take on this crazy challenge? We can take that same desire to conquer and channel it to something much more useful. We can take the warrior spirit found in many young people (particularly men) and use it to create a world-wide peace keeping force. Because make no mistake the world needs protecting. There will always be some would be dictator who wants to grab for power. It has been that way since the beginning of history, it will not suddenly stop now. The trick will be to embrace this stage but not collapse into it. We will need to find the balance between deeply honoring the peace keepers willing to sacrifice their lives, but not get caught up into war hysteria when war comes our way.</p>
<p>Jim Channon, a high stage officer in the U.S. Army had a vision of warrior monks who protect the world as it evolves to the next stage:</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811190649/http://arcturus.org/field_manual.pdf">First Earth Battalion</a></p>
<p>He wrote this in 1982 (during the Reagan presidency) so he was very much ahead of his time, but I think he was on to something. Many young people <em>want</em> to be warriors. Let&rsquo;s put that to good use because we will need their protection. It will let the youth channel all that aggressiveness into something positive.</p>

<h2 id="blue">Blue</h2>
<p>When Gandhi was asked what he thought about Western civilization, he (maybe apocryphally) responded, &ldquo;It would be a good idea&rdquo;. He of course had a point, but the British empire should get some credit for not simply shooting him. Other rulers would not have hesitated. For example, when the older leaders in Guatemala were confronted with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_Guatemalan_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat">U.S backed right wing coup</a> they counseled the younger leaders to respond with non-violent protests. These older leaders were then all summarily executed. The remaining  younger leaders headed to the hills and a brutal thirty year, genocidal civil war was launched. No one gained from this. England was operating from Blue, the Guatemalan right wing dictators were clearly in Red. We desperately need more Blue in this world.</p>
<p>Consider the Mormons. Most people have a blindspot about this religion. For sure they are  patriarchal and deeply bigoted. We don&rsquo;t have to condone everything they do, but they do have some things to teach us. They have part of the answer. Something they are doing is actually working. Mormons know that they are part of something much, much bigger than themselves. Mitt Romney said exactly that when he courageously cast the lone Republican vote for impeachment. That is the gift of Blue. There is something vibrant here. The focus turns away from just me and mine to community and service. We recognize we are part of a greater whole. Mormons support each other. Families work much better because they are supported by a vibrant community. Children are raised with a sense of purpose and belonging. Most Americans have lost the skill of getting along with their neighbors. Most Americans don&rsquo;t even know who their neighbors are! But most Mormons do. Utah (the home of the Mormon church) calls itself the Beehive state to symbolize this sense of togetherness. Salt Lake City is one of the most vibrant cities in the country.</p>
<p>We have had a disastrous collapse of Blue in America. In <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/11/02/930271185/in-the-upswing-history-holds-the-keys-to-moving-away-from-todays-tumultuous-age">The Upswing: How America Came Together a Century Ago and How We Can Do It Again</a>, Robert Putnam describes how America eventually emerged from the horrible strife of the Civil War and started to find its way back to community starting in the 1870&rsquo;s. Women organized to get the right to vote, workers endured getting shot to unionize, and wealth became more evenly divided. We forget how before this seniors quite often died in miserable poverty. We forget how children before this died from eating tainted food. We forget how workers died fighting to give us the 40 hour work week. Even Blacks, although still treated horribly at least gained some increase in prosperity.  People felt a call to be of service to their community. This all started to collapse in the 70&rsquo;s. Income inequality is now higher than even in the Gilded Age (1890&rsquo;s), and in the 2020 election the Republican party formally voted to overthrow the election. We have not been this divided since the Civil War. We don&rsquo;t want the sexism and racism that typically comes with Blue, but we desperately need that sense of community again. We need this gift.</p>

<p>One year when my son was in grade school, I came to his class every week and taught the kids how to make a little turtle on the screen do things. I told the kids things like, try making the turtle draw a triangle, great now how about a square?, great now how about a pentagon?, and so on until they eventually created a circle. The kids loved it so much that one week they asked &ldquo;Mr. Levy why are we getting to do this?&rdquo;. They thought they were just playing games at school. I simply said &ldquo;This is math&rdquo; and they coiled back in shock and horror. One of the stronger programmers started talking to herself out loud, &ldquo;Math? I can&rsquo;t do math&rdquo;. For a horrible moment it looked like it could tip towards the kids giving up. That girl went helpless. Fortunately, the fun proved to be too enticing and they were able to go back to enjoying themselves. They learned solid math that typically is not covered until high school (xy coordinate system, angles, reflections, rotations, functions, etc.) but they didn&rsquo;t even really think of it as a class. At the end I asked who realized now that math can be fun and creative. Everyone&rsquo;s hand shot up.</p>
<p>Science is amazing. Math is incredibly beautiful and powerful. There is a deep refuge in logical thought. But most people don&rsquo;t know this. When I get lost in my programming it feels like I am strolling through serene, crystalline groves. It is an incredibly soothing sanctuary. We have always been natural scientists, but what this stage brings is the disclipine and rigor of math and logic. We need this stage too. We need to trust that numbers are real. Most anti-vaxers don&rsquo;t really believe in numbers, because it is too abstract. They don&rsquo;t really believe the spike in cases because they are not personally affected. And here is the funny thing &ndash; numbers kind of aren&rsquo;t real. They are this abstract idea. It is a leap of faith to trust that this abstract stage is &ldquo;real&rdquo;. People don&rsquo;t just naturally get there, they usually have to be taught. And we are not doing such a great job of teaching kids this. Math and science are usually presented as yet another burden they must bear instead of this incredible gift.</p>
<p>We can not solve some of our most urgent problems unless and until we convince people that numbers are real. The numbers around Covid hospitalizations for vaccinated vs. unvaccinated are real. The numbers describing the coming climate catastrophe are real. The numbers supporting the analysis of systemic racism are real. The numbers of women reporting sexual harrassment and abuse are real. But simply reciting the facts to an anti-vaxxer won&rsquo;t help. Unless and until we can get them to where they truly believe numbers are real you can recite all the facts you like they simply will not be able to take it in.</p>
<p>And we now flooded with so many different &ldquo;expert&rdquo; opinions. How do we really know that the 2020 elections were not stolen? How do we know that Global warming is not just a hoax cooked up by the Chinese? How do we know that vaccinations are statistically safe? Unless and until people have a firm grounding in the scientific method they are at the mercy of every stray internet posting. And again we teach kids Science as if it is a collection of facts to remember instead of a world view to cultivate. Unless and until we get more people to open up their science minds we will not be able to convince them of how urgently we need change.</p>

<p>I believe we will heal this world one commmunity at at time. For many years I lived in <a href="https://www.cohousing.org/">Cohousing</a> which is a kind of intentional neighborhood. It has a little bit of the vibe of a commune, but everyone owns their own homes with mostly normal bank loans. People choose to live there because they want to live in a community where everyone knows everyone else. It is basically just a return to how it used to be. And it can be very magical. When I moved into Winslow Cohousing on Bainbridge island my son was a very picky eater. But the boys he hung out with at cohousing had been eating common house meals since they were very young, and used to eating all sorts of weird thing. It turns out sometimes peer pressure can be a very good thing. Within a year my son was chastising me (quite correctly) about my unhealthy eating habits! Kids do better in a supportive, loving community. It is not natural or healthy to not have connections to your neighbors. And Cohousing is very Green.</p>
<p>Cohousing is a bottom up, grass roots movement, so each forming community chooses how they organize. But pretty much all cohousing communities choose to do a very radical thing &ndash; they choose to govern by consensus. That means that on all important decisions every adult member of the community has to agree. Getting to consensus is actually even harder than it sounds. Typically a cohousing community has around 50-60 adults. I can not adequately describe to you the tedium and frustration of getting 55 adults to agree on what color to paint the exterior walls. Many cohousers get pretty frustrated with the process. But it teaches something incredibly valuable. It teaches us how to listen to everyone. Listen even to those we disagree with. Because everyones opinion matters. And when people know that their viewpoint is going to be respected, not simply swept aside, their bellies unclench. Real communication happens when people are speaking from unclenched bellies. And from that more relaxed place, you suddenly can realize, &ldquo;Huh. I guess they have a point. I hadn&rsquo;t thought of it like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This stage is where we realize that our &ldquo;rationality&rdquo; is mostly an illusion. It is mostly a social construct. This is where we start to realize that finding &ldquo;Truth&rdquo; is not nearly so simple as we thought. That there are many equally valid perspectives that all contradict each other, and yet each is True. This is where we recognize how much oppression and needless suffering there is in the world, and no longer accept this suffering is inevitable.</p>
<h3 id="gifts-5">Gifts</h3>
<ul>
<li>Egalitarian</li>
<li>Post-rational</li>
<li>Everyone matters</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="yellow-second-tier">Yellow (Second Tier)</h2>
<p>The fact that you have read so far means you are very likely at least emerging Yellow. Until you get to this stage people don&rsquo;t seem to be ready to even talk much about stages.  And you certainly don&rsquo;t have tolerance for the other stages. For example, when I talk to someone at Green about people at Red, the person at Green usually can&rsquo;t get past their anger. Why are they like that? Why can&rsquo;t they simply see how wrong they are? It doesn&rsquo;t matter how smart you are (and there are incredibly smart people at the Green stage) unless you have done some deep work you can&rsquo;t see that you have all the stages within. At Yellow you start to recognize this is true. Once you go looking it is pretty easy to find Beige and Purple inside yourself because they are so delightful. Red I admit is harder for me. But I did some experimentation with BDSM and found domination/submission is electri. That means I too have Red in me. It actually scares me to admit how much of a wild monster I have inside myself. Notice how much inner work this required. That is the one of the key gits of Yellow is that we start to find out how vast we are. And part of that is to recognize that we have all the stages within us.</p>
<p>Why is it so important to recognize this? First because it helps us live a much richer, meaninful life, but second because it makes us much more effective. If you simply keep on telling someone about global warming (or systemic racism, or sexism, etc.) and they are not at the stage where they can hear you, you are actually making the situation worse. You have to meet them where they are.</p>
