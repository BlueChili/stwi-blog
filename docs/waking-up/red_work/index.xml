      <description>As I write this bombs are still falling on Ukraine. A mother and her child are killed trying to get into a shelter. This has been going on for far, far too long. So many war crimes committed by Russia. Millions of people have fled the country, and the people still there have to deal with senseless death falling from the sky. We cheer as we watch the Ukrainians bravely fight back against what at first seemed hopeless odds.</description>

      <title>Change</title>

      <description>Change is messy and scary so we resist with all our might. But it is what we have to do. We can stay blocked for years and years, but organicity is always striving towards health and eventually something has to give. Let me give an example.
I was in Guatemala with my ex-wife for a month and midway through my testosterone prescription ran out. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get a refill but it turns out that Guatemalan pharmacies will sell you pretty much anything they have without the need for a prescription.</description>
