This section could be challenging. Most of us doing this work are coming from strong Green, and Green does not see eye to eye with MAGA seditionists and religious zealots. Nor should it; those are  very dark representations of Red and Blue. But it is important to not let that blind us to the gift these levels bring as well; the warrior and the mystic.  We all have an inner warrior. We all have an inner mystic. Some people have an easy affinity with these archetypes. Not me â€”  it took me quite a while to find my way to them.  How about you? Stop here and check in with yourself. Where are you with your warrior? Where are you with your mystic? Are you aware of them? Are they places within yourself that you find easily or do you resist?

Ok here is the challenging part. We need to love those MAGA seditionists and religious zealots too. In fact we especially have to love them. And if that is not challenging enough we also have to embrace them as our mirror. Mirror?!? How could that possibly be?! I get it, sounds impossible right? Please just stay curious for now.
