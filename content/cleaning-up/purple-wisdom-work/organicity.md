I’m afraid that by just reading this site you will get the impression that this personal growth stuff is all very serious, hard work that involves a lot of suffering. It can be that way, but it doesn’t have to be.  If you find the right healing group this work actually becomes tremendous fun. Yes it is still very challenging, but it just feels right. You are not alone. Others are doing similar work as you and you are supporting each other every step of the way. There is a knowing within and a sense of flowing in the right direction. That is the heart of organicity. We learn to trust that our organism is always striving towards health. Always. We intuitively know what we need, we just need to get out of our own way to let it happen. 

This work is best supported by groups, but Americans have gotten so hyper-individualized that they have forgotten how to be in a group. That is where Cohousing comes in.  I watched one of the “burning souls” of the Cohousing movement give a speech once. He started off by asking some questions. “How many of you know the names of at least one of your neighbors or their kids? One? Two? Three? More than Three?” Some hands went up initially but quickly went down as the numbers went up. Next question. “If you needed to borrow a car how many neighbors could you borrow from? One? Two? Three? More than Three?”  Even less hands this time. “If you needed a ride to the hospital is there a neighbor you could ask?” No one’s hand went up. Then he continued. “Now I’m going to spend a little time talking today about a very radical experiment in housing. Don’t worry I will spend most of my time talking about the traditional Cohousing model where everyone knows their neighbor. But first let’s talk about this set up where everyone lives alone. This is a very new concept, and I’m not sure it is working out that well. I personally would not feel comfortable putting my kids in such an unusual experiment.  I prefer to stick to the time tested ways of living like it always has been done!”.  The audience laughed, but they got his point.
