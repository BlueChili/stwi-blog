      <description>In first grade I had my first spiritual experience. I was walking down a long corridor thinking about how I want to keep on doing good things while simultaneously feeling kind of embarrassed and hokey and suddenly the light coming in from the windows got very strong and I was walking into this welcoming, warm light wrapping all around me. Yes. This. I will always step into the light. Always. This is my most precious gift.</description>

      <description>When you do a Medicine ceremony quite often an amazing revelation will come. Something earth shaking and amazing now becomes apparent. That is the amazing gift of Medicine. But all by itself that insight is not worth much. What next needs to happen is integrating the insight into you life. A good guide encourages you to keep on bringing that new awareness and insight into awareness.</description>

      <description>The problem with Green is that it is prone to staying in victim. It gets caught up in group think and endless purity tests. And people tend to stay small. They wait for the Great Leader to guide the way, not realizing that they themselves can be that leader. When Green first appeared we made great leaps forward, but recently progress has slowed and in some areas we&amp;rsquo;re even heading backwards.</description>
