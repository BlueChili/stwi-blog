As I write this bombs are still falling on Ukrainian homes. This has been going on for much too long. Millions of people have fled the country, and the people still there have to deal with senseless death falling from the sky. We cheer as we watch the Ukrainians bravely fight back against what at first seemed hopeless odds. Sometimes there is no choice but to meet violence with violence. In World War II most of the world had collapsed into authoritarian Red. The only thing that saved us was armed conflict; nothing else would do against Hitler and Tojo. Unbelievable numbers of people died in the resistance but it was sadly necessary. What we forget is that most of the people we were fighting, the Germans, the Japanese, believed that they too were doing the hard but necessary thing. They also were dying for something they believed in. When it gets this bad we have no choice but to fight. But our goal is to create a world where it doesn't get that bad. How do we do that? Again, we need systems thinking. We need to go deep enough to really get to the root of the problem. And as always that leads us right back to ourselves.

This war mentality is not just something that lives out there disconnected from everything else. We also have wars in our own minds. Of course we do! This is where war springs from -- where else would it come from? And just like those determined Germans thinking they were doing the hard but necessary work of fixing the world, we sometimes declare war on ourselves thinking it is the only way. I know because I did myself back when I declared war on myself in high school over the acne cysts.  So many of us attack and belittle ourselves. We tell ourselves stories about how unattractive we are, or stupid, or lazy or whatever. And it really hurts. This pain is real and it cripples us. We can't start to heal until we stop this violence within.

And violence has no place with our children. None whatsoever. And yet we stand by and watch children get hit or screamed at. Stand by and watch as if those kids have no rights of their own. As if they are simply their parent's property to do with as they please. And how did those parents end up like that? From their own parents. It is a long, sad cycle of pain. Putin's childhood was [quite harsh][1]. He grew up in a traumatizing environment where he was abandoned and bullied. The psychologists, Alice Miller [writes][2]:

> "Children who are given love, respect, understanding, kindness, and warmth will naturally develop different characteristics from those who experience neglect, contempt, violence or abuse, and never have anyone they can turn to for kindness and affection. Such absence of trust and love is a common denominator in the formative years of all the dictators I have studied."

She goes on to talk about how harsh Hitler and Stalin's childhoods were and how that inevitably lead to their acting out later. We seem to have a huge blindspot here. Again the revolutionary vanguard has to have preschool and kindergarden teachers leading the way. We are not going to get to the world we want without vastly better child raising.
