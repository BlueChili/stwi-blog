This is the base. Everything has to be built on top of this. In Hakomi we were taught to build a loving "bubble" between ourselves and our client. In HAI it comes from the deep love from the facilitators and the team. They are all there because they are deeply committed to love and together they create the same "bubble" but for an entire room. The very first thing the facilitators do is to model loving, tender connection with each other. So people can experience what it looks like.

We explicitly encourage people to be loving both towards themselves and towards others. We model loving people no matter what comes up for them. No one is made wrong. Facilitators (and hopefully team) model always speaking from their heart. Simply declaring from the heart that this is the Room of Love opens it up as a possibility.
