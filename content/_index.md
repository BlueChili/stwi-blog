# Welcome!

Thank you so much visiting this web site! I am deeply grateful that you did! Your support and feedback is precious to me -- it will help me create something of value. I won't get there without you. Seriously.

My goal is to save the world. I hope to convince you to join me. I need allies. This world needs allies.

For thirty years I have watched global warming coming. Back in the 90's environmentalists like myself knew exactly what was coming. The science was clear. And I did nothing. Each decade the scientific reports kept on coming back consistently reporting that it was even worse than we feared. And I did nothing. The scientific reports are so bad now I can not make myself read them. It hurts too much. If you know how to read them, you know the scientists are actually screaming in anguish to an uncaring populace. And I did nothing.

No longer.

My daughter asked me if it is OK to have children. And I had to really think about it. I found myself bargaining with God. Maybe her children will be OK? But then she asks me what about her children's children? And what about all future children? And the answer is I do not know.

What I do know is that I will not do nothing for another thirty years. The world needs even someone as ordinary as me. No matter how hard the work might be I can not imagine anything more painful than to have a conversation with my grandchildren thirty years from now and have to confess to them that yet again for another thirty years I did nothing.

Fortunately, while I did (mostly) nothing others have been hard at work. They have done so much and yet here we are.  On our own we can only get so far. All the urgent projects that people are working on such as Black Lives Matter and Social Justice are vitally important. But we need to understand that we are all working on the same project. We need to join together as one. So even as we continue to do our separate work we also need to coordinate on an even bigger dream -- saving all the world together.  

This site is a home for this bigger dream. For big problems like this we need the collective intelligence and wisdom of as many people as we can get. This site is set up to encourage and enable people to collarborate. Because we have work to do. We need to come up with something very new and very big. To paraphrase Einstein, you can not solve problems with the same consciousness that created them. We can not just keep on doing what we have been doing and expect things to just take care of themselves. We have learned so much in the last thirty years, now it is time to put all that learning into something that can save the world. We don't have much time. We are on a deadline.

What are the deeper causes of why the world is the way it is? What is that prevents people from opening their hearts wider and wider? What would it take on a practical level to save the world? I have been looking for people with workable answers. And they are out there! The problem seems to be that we need to bring these separate teachings together into an integrated whole. And we need to realize that all the urgent projects such as Black Lives Matter, Feminism, etc. all are working on the same goal -- expanding people's hearts to take in everyone. First we need to cultivate these teachings in ourselves because of course it has to start there, but then once we find our feet we can then look out to others and ask, "What is that we want to create together?"

I am going to first start with what I have found. And then I am going to ask you what have you found? How do we together create an even bigger dream together?

We are going to need the following.

### Better Story

We first need a better story of our history. How did we get here and where do we want to go next? Why do our opponents believe as they do and how can we see them more clearly and compassionately?  What has worked in the past to shift hearts and minds? How do we use that again?

Most important this story will provide us hope that something huge might just want to awaken soon.

### Better Healing

When I am hurting, my personal world collapses down. All I can manage is just to make it through the day. Collectively the world is hurting. Most people are in too much pain to do the bigger work. We need to help them get out of their pain. There have been some exciting breakthroughs in therapy that need to reach more people. When people emerge out of pain, incredible things happen. We need to allow that to happen.

### Better Culture

Our way of living is no longer working. Once we understand our story and then step out of our pain that makes room for change. Radical change. I don't yet know exactly what this is going to be. I will need your help for this part. But imagine us coming together as a loving, supportive tribe that works together. That will be the core of it. And it will feel really good to be part of. With great parties. Did I mention how much fun this is all going to be?

We could start telling ourselves a different story than we have been. That this could actually work. Work well enough so that we can maybe start to dream a bigger dream than we have so far. Start to dream of what is possible if only enough of us could get out of our pain and step into the joy of service. And from there maybe we can step into a whole world of joy. Why not?

I can't guarantee that we will get there. The possibility of failure is always very real, but I would not be creating this website if I did not truly, truly believe it is possible. The very first step is to hope. Are you willing to take that risk with me?

To care? I think I do know what I'm asking of you. Please join me anyways.
