* Non violence
* Mindfulness
* Mind/Body
* Truth
* Change
* Organicity
* Unity
* Loving Presence

These principles are a foundation we can build on. They can be our North star to help guide us when we get lost. They work together. All of them are necessary. If a Hakomi session didn't go well, students are taught to look to the principles to see what was missing. This brings us back to systems thinking. Asking "why?" to go deeper and deeper so that we can embrace all parts of the system.

[Hakomi](https://hakomiinstitute.com/) started with five founding principles. Loving Presence was added [here](https://hakomiinstitute.com/about/hakomi-mindful-somatic-psychotherapy/the-hakomi-principles). Truth and Change were added [here](https://www.hakomica.org/about-hakomi/method-process). This brings us to eight principles which seems like the [right number]({{< relref "/posts/eight.md" >}}) to me.

These principles guide a therapist when working with a client. But they also are principles that can guide the therapist to lead their own lives. So they are used for both Healing Up and Wising Up work. And in the Waking Up stage these principles can guide us into fully awakening into our full and highest potential.

## Non violence
## Mindfulness
## Mind/Body
## Truth
## Change
## Organicity
## Unity
## Loving Presence

Let's start with Healing up. The very, very first thing we need for healing is a safe place to do our work. And how do we create that? A deep commitment to non-violence. Hakomi starts here.
