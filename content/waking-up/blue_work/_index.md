In first grade I had my first spiritual experience. I was walking down a long corridor thinking about how I want to keep on doing good things while simultaneously feeling kind of embarrassed and hokey and suddenly the light coming in from the windows got very strong and I was walking into this welcoming, warm light wrapping all around me. Yes. This. I will always step into the light. Always. This is my most precious gift. I will always step towards the light of Truth even if it requires walking over broken glass. I don't know how to teach this to others -- it was kind of just given to me.
