# Beige

In the very beginning, our ancestors somehow someway had the first awakening. We stepped into a level of consciousness higher than other animals. A caveman dad is sitting on a rock with his child looking up at the full moon. The child says "Dad, what is that?" And both feel the awe and wonder of the world and their place in it. This is where it all started. We and our ancestors have been using fire and primitive tools for maybe a million years. We don't know when we started to use language and when we became aware of I, You, and Us. But awaken we did. We now had a higher vantage point of consciousness. Something different than other animals.

This is my favorite stage. It is a reminder that we are at our core are animals. Thinking animals, yes, but always and forever animals. Here we revel in the delights of our bodies and feel at one with our world. This is what I strive to return to when I go backpacking. We are meant to be part of nature not separate from it. There is a powerful spirituality in simply fully letting in the beauty of the world. This is the level with the best sex -- primal and in the moment. This is where we go when we sit in front of a fire in the dark with friends and family and tell stories. This is the place we return to when we fully surrender to sweaty dance.

We find that when doing the deep work of healing trauma that it has to start here. In the body. [The body keeps the score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Body_Keeps_the_Score). Animals like deers, instinctively know that when something traumatic happens like getting chased by a mountain lion, they have to take a moment and shake it off. The body has a deep wisdom of its own. But what a miracle to find conscious mind inside our bodies. What a delicious thing it is to look out at the world and be a part of it yet separate.

There seems to be a longing in modern society to return to this level. This is the level people go to in a Zombie Apocalypse movie. A small band striving to survive in a hostile world where everyone is trying to kill them. This is the level survivalists and preppers are living in -- in the end you can't trust anyone else to keep you and yours alive.

And just like in a Zombie Apocalypse series this survivalism eventually starts to pall. It is not enough to simply survive. We need something more. We crave meaning and purpose. And we start to look to others and begin to see the outlines of a bigger vision.

Something amazing happened about 30,000 years ago. We see it in the [cave paintings] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lascaux#:~:text=Lascaux%20(French%3A%20Grotte%20de%20Lascaux,and%20ceilings%20of%20the%20cave.) of the time. When we stop and really look at this powerful art we can not help but be moved. These people were just like us. This was clearly the next step up in consciousness. From smallish bands we formed bigger tribes and we became bad-asses. Human population numbers started to grow and we spread out across pretty much all of the planet. Starting from this time the of populations of bigger animals like Mastodons crashed. Presumably because we hunted them to death.

And spirit became the center of our lives. Spirit of place, animal, and ancestors. Deep magic lives in the sacred places. Animal spirits and our ancestors are here to guide us, if only we can get quiet enough and reverent to hear them. We fast and pray for days. Then head off alone into the wilderness to do our sacred initiation rite, but return to the wild celebration of the tribe. You are back! We are so glad you are back! We are one. Tell us of your visions so that we may all learn from the spirits. You are home. You are loved. So deeply loved.

Purple throws the best parties. It is a big part of the draw of the hippies in the 60's. From all accounts Woodstock was very purple. We tend to idolize this stage, but movies like [Dances With Wolves[(https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099348/)] do catch an important historical point. Colonists "kidnapped" by Native Americans almost *never* wanted to return when given the opportunity. The Native Americans were living a much richer, more satisfying life.

And yet we know the story does not end here. Why on earth would we leave this stage? And yet we did. It started innocently enough -- we simply started to settle down into once place so we could grow and raise our food. Why? Maybe the pressure of increased population nudged us towards agriculture. The land can only support so many hunter gatherers. To support even higher populations you need to create more food. So agriculture was born. And the next stage arose.

Archeology records show that the first agricultural communities continued the egalitarian traditions of hunter gatherers. Everyone was (mostly) equal still. But then as the populations got even larger, a new thing arose. We chose to become as Gods.

There is a real darkness here. Pharoahs were content to let countless slaves suffer and die in order to build the pyramids that marked their godhood. A lot of the suffering of the world still comes from this stage of thinking. And yet. We would become as Gods! Without this this stage we would not have known the wonder of skipping across the moon. From looking up in wonder and awe at the moon, to landing on it and driving around in a go-kart. Think of what we are justifiably most proud of as a species -- conquering disease, discovering the big bang, airplanes, exquisite, advanced music and art. All of these had to start with the crazy determination to go to that next level. We were not content to simply stay just as we are.
