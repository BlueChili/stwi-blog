Before I go into the plan, I think it is useful maybe even necessary to talk a little about myself first. Who is this person begging you to hope and care? What particular viewpoint am I coming from?

I'm a 58 year old white male living in the Bay Area. I have two kids (Ulysses and Jaiya) from separate marriages and they are the world to me. I've been a software programmer most of my life, and I love programming. I'm book smart so I did well academically. I am a seeker of Truth. When I was younger I was in a lot of pain. The way I found myself out of that pain was doing intensive personal growth workshops. It was the only thing that seemed to work. I tried a few Freudian psychiatrists but their approach seemed (and still does frankly) like mostly nonsense. So personal growth workshops it was. And I did a lot of them. The month of my 50th birthday I did a particularly powerful workshop and I stepped into a lot of joy. I finally committed to fully loving myself and others. It was a kind of spiritual awakening, and brought me into a lot of joy. And then a few years later I did psychedelic Medicine work and went into even deeper joy. Now that I am mostly out of pain, my focus has shifted to service. I want to help people not just find their way out of pain, but into their own joy. It is right there waiting for all of us. Just begging to be let in. Somehow, someway I want to help that happen. After taking a number of trainings I am just now embarking on a side practice as Medicine guide. I am also deepening my meditation practice and after some more trainings I would like to teach [Mindful Self Compassion](https://centerformsc.org/).

And then there is my spiritual awakening. People who really know me describe me as very love based. I find that description astonishing. It is like saying I am very oxygen based. Of course I am oxygen based! I am quite attached to breathing. But so are you! And just like we sometimes forget to stop and really let ourselves breathe, we also quite often forget to stop and let ourselves really love. To me it seems obvious that everything is Love. Everything. We come from Love and return to Love. You know this to be true. Yes really. There are maybe only fleeting moments when this was really clear for you, but then as we all do you forgot. The trick is to forget less and less. I promise you there is an immense amount of joy to be found in the remembering.

So why talk about myself? Because this site is meant to be a practical example of what I am asking for. The world I hope to help create is going to require all of me. The engineer, the personal growth explorer, and the spiritual dreamer. All of me. But of course all by myself I can accomplish nothing. So I need to inspire you to bring in all of yourself. What unique combination of gifts are you for the world? How can we deepen and strengthen all that you have to offer?. We need all of you. And together I want to create a world that truly welcomes and celebrates the wild diversity and richness of the world. We need all of us.

While I was participating in all those workshops and having those spiritual breakthroughs I was always a little ashamed of being an engineer. It seemed like something so different from what the world needed. I thought the world needed more therapists and gifted workshop leaders, not more programmers. And it does. But the world needs many things right now. It turns out that engineers can offer something as well. In fact when I looked closer, there are a surprising number of things that programmers can teach the world. I talk about that in a separate post [TODO -- link to side document], but the key thing to know here is that I bring an engineer's practical, result oriented mindset to this project. I know the critical importance of theory, but I also know not to bring too much in. I have done a lot of reading, and I am happy to do a lot more if you have suggestions, but all that reading needs to be distilled down into the simplest and most practical plan that can work. And software engineers know how critically important it is to get feedback because software gets better and better the more eyes you put on it. And the best way to harness that phenomenon? Open Source.
