There is a lot of truly great writing about mindfulness. For example, Mark Manson has an excellent article [here](https://markmanson.net/benefits-of-meditation). He writes in his vivid way of all the amazing benefits both healthwise and mental. But in that article he lightly touches upon something that is often overlooked. We tend to think of meditation as the only way to cultivate mindfulness. It is not. Meditation is not the answer to all our problems. In fact, [too much meditation](https://harpers.org/archive/2021/04/lost-in-thought-psychological-risks-of-meditation/) can lead to [spiritual emergencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiritual_crisis) that can crush someone or even lead them to suicide. Don't get me wrong -- I love meditation. I meditate daily in front of my beloved altar and it has helped me a lot. It is just that I have seen too many people take up meditation as The One True Way, when it is just one of the ways, and not even a complete way at that.

There are many ways besides meditation to cultivate mindfulness. Hakomi clients are constant coached to go within. To really notice what is going on with their bodies and to get just curious. To recognize that internal voice that is always talking and to really start listening to what it is saying without necessarily reacting to it. The therapist acts as a support to help them lean into the things that are hard and hurt. The therapist first checks to see if it is OK to proceed (non-violence principle) and then maybe asks them to breathe into the pain. Asks the client in different ways to get curious about whatever is happening in the moment (truth principle). And just like yoga starts off awkward and stumbling but eventually becomes much more smooth if you do it enough, if you do this kind of inquiry enough you start to develop the habit of mindfulness. You start to notice what is happening even without the therapist directing you to.


Healing revolves around mindfulness. We encourage people to stop, take a breath, and really pay attention to what is going on with themselves. We gently prompt them to close their eyes and really get in touch with how they are feeling. This is a core method.

We tend to get caught up in the strong currents of our emotions. The first step is mindful awareness of what is swirling around inside us. But then the next step is to get deeply curious. Why am I so angry? My goodness there is so much anger flowing through my body! I wonder what is going on here? What beliefs do I have about what just happened? Both HAI and Hakomi make a point to encourage people to get really curious about what is going on within themselves. Curiosity takes us out of judgment and opens up new possibilities. Do I really need to get so angry about that?

It is so easy to forget to do this. Constant reminders to “get really curious…” are needed. This switches us away from judgment and blame to simply wanting to understand.
