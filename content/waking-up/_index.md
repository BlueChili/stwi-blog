“Cleaning Up” is a good foundation to build on. But everything I talked about there is pretty standard personal growth 101. It is necessary that we start there but by itself it won’t get us where we need to go. We now are going to step into some work that is harder..

“Waking Up” combines the fierce ambition to conquer the world with learning the grace of surrendering to something bigger than ourselves. Think of Martin Luther King. He came from a place of righteous anger that would not be turned aside, but he led us all to a place of much bigger love. That is what “Waking Up” brings to the world. We need more of this. So far not so bad. But to master this stage we also have to really make peace with the darkness here. I’m going to ask you to embrace your inner asshole and encourage you to step out on to the skinniest branches of woo woo. 

Most of us doing this work are coming from strong Green, and Green does not see eye to eye with MAGA seditionists and religious zealots. Nor should it. But it is important to not let that blind us to the gift these levels bring as well; the warrior and the mystic.  We all have an inner warrior. We all have an inner mystic. Some people have an easy affinity with these archetypes. Not me —  it took me quite a while to find my way to them.  How about you? Stop here and check in with yourself. Where are you with your warrior? Where are you with your mystic? Are you aware of them? Are they places within yourself that you find easily or do you resist?

HSacreSere is the challenging part. We need to love those MAGA seditionists and religious zealots too. In fact we especially have to love them. And if that is not challenging enough we also have to embrace them as our mirror. Mirror?!? How could that possibly be?! I get it, it sounds impossible right? Please just stay curious for now.
