All of the stages come with both gifts and shadows. I will touch on the shadow side first. The part that is hurting and not working well. The part that is causing harm in the world.

## Beige

The shadow version of this stage is simple survival. We all are at this stage from time to time, the question is how long we stay here. For example, when I have a bad flu my world collapses down to simply surviving. I no longer am thinking about saving the world because I am too caught up in my own suffering. I don't have energy for anything else. This is the stage people go to when displaced by natural disasters. But it also is, I suspect, the stage people who are deeply traumatized tend to go to. The world is an unsafe place and there are monsters everywhere waiting to leap out. Kind of like a Zombie apocalypse movie. Constant vigilance is required.

A lot of the world spends at least part of the time here. It doesn't matter how much money you have, if you spend your life in constant fear you are living in survival mode. Unless and until we get people out of this hurt and lack we can't expect them to do anything else.

People are desperately hungry for tribe. This is a driving need. If people can't find a healthy way to express this need they will make do with an unhealthy way. Somehow, some way this need must be met. We are seeing a world wide resurgence of ethnic nationalism -- which is an unhealthy expression of this tribal hunger. It explains some (but not all) of the attraction to Trump. His rallies were a potent drug. People felt part of a tribal whole and they were desperately missing that. How do we counter this? I will talk about deeper solutions in later sections, but possibly the simplest intervention is to get people to switch to a healthier tribe. The most successful way to get people to leave a white nationalist groups is to find a different group for them to join. The thing they really are looking for is that sense of group pride, belonging and togetherness.

This is the big one. For some reason in the U.S. when we reach for an example of ultimate evil we go to the Nazis. As if we don't have something even worse (if that is possible) in our own history. Slavery. Genocide. And that slave owner mindset is still very much with us even today. This darkness has been with us a long time. We are taught to revere the Greek and Roman empires. Yes they had amazing achievements, but they were also brutal slave regimes. Just like us. We are all complicit.

I am writing this in the winter of 2021. It is not clear to me whether democracy will survive in the U.S. The Republicans are in the midst of purging from their party anyone who tells the truth about Trump's lies. And the voters seem to be fine with this. The 2022 elections will almost certainly sweep in a Republican majority in the house, and quite possibly the senate as well. The majority of Republicans voted to overturn the 2020 election. After all these purges there is no doubt that they will be even more agressive to overturn the 2024 election. Or they might not even need to. Like I said many voters seem to be fine with all of these shenanigans. And this is not unique to the U.S. [Authoritarianism is on the rise worldwide](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2021/democracy-under-siege). Russia, an emboldened China, [India](https://freedomhouse.org/country/india/freedom-world/2021), Poland, Hungary, Phillipines, Brazil, Turkey are examples of states either firmly authoritarian or succumbing to it just like us.

So we all have a front row seat to the shadow of Red. The first thing we notice are the lies. But Red doesn't think of it that way. They think they are creating their own reality. Consider this [conversation with a George W. Bush aide](https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/17/magazine/faith-certainty-and-the-presidency-of-george-w-bush.html)

> The aide said that guys like me were "in what we call the reality-based community," which he defined as people who "believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality." I nodded and murmured something about enlightenment principles and empiricism. He cut me off. "That's not the way the world really works anymore," he continued. "We're an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you're studying that reality -- judiciously, as you will -- we'll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that's how things will sort out. We're history's actors . . . and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do."

"We are an empire now, and we when we act, we create our own reality." That is the heart of Red. Truth as something greater than yourself is just not something that Red has online yet. So when Trump lies his followers celebrate it as a sign of strength. They applaud Trump creating his own reality. And they laugh at the rest of us trying to study what he just did.

In the 1400's China was the dominant world power. The emperor sent enormous treasure fleets all the way to India and Africa. The size and technical sophistication of this fleet eclipsed anything the Europeans or any other country had. The Chinese knew about Europe, but it was much too poor to bother with. China could have ruled the wold if they wanted. Instead subsequent emperors disbanded the fleets and stricly forbade all exploration. It cost them. The empire stagnated and when Europeans finally managed to launch much, much smaller exploratory fleets of their own, they found a China easy to bully and ultimately colonize. Blue can be wonderfully stable and it can provide much better governance than despotic Red, but it can easily go stagnant and complacent. And even if it doesn't go stagnant that inward focus holds back progress as Japan found out when those American "Black Ships" came barging into Tokyo harbor.

Blue encourages a kind of magical thinking. Everything is going to be OK because -- fill in the blank. Everything is going to be OK because China is the center of the world and always will be. Climate change is OK because God will take care of us. Billions of people dying is regrettable but OK because Buddha taught us to accept suffering. Blue also expects unquestioning obedience. Go over to Vietnam and start shooting people. Don't ask questions about why we are doing this just start shooting! Father knows best, no more questions. There can be a rigidity and intolerance. Anyone not following the True path is impure and needs to be purged.

## Orange

Orange gets caught in the trap that only scientific thinking is valid. This kind of thinking ruthlessly splits the world into separate, dead parts. The universe is a cold uncaring place and you die alone. Progress is measured primarily in economic terms. [Greed is Good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bbzwJ0Sx48). How much stuff do you have? How big is your bank account? There are many, many authors that do a great job of describing this mentality so I don't want to spend too much time on this. Basically if you have read any environmentalist book you should be familiar with this critique. I think the environmentalists are clearly right, but hopefully you already understand this.

The other part is that just as the shadow of Red continues the mindset of the slave owner, the shadow of Orange continues the mindset of the imperialistic colonizer. The mindset of take anything I want. The mindset of the [white man's burden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Man%27s_Burden). This mindset of appropriation without giving credit is still very much alive today. For example the otherwise very good [Dialectical Behavior Therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_behavior_therapy) makes almost no mention of the enormous debt it owes to Buddhism. The heart of the practice is clearly ripped straight out of Buddhist practice, but you would not know that if you read any of the descriptions of it. This is the arrogant mindset that until the enlightened scientist came along none of this mindfulness stuff was true. Oh sure those primitive Buddhists might have accidentally stumbled onto a couple of useful things, but it is the scientists burden to get all of this properly sorted.

When I first drove to the Evergreen State University, I was dumbstruck by all the trees. Once I got to the school I still had to drive through several miles of trees before I got to the main campus. We didn't have trees like that in Illinois. Land is so valuable for farming that very few trees are suffered to live. Lots of trees on a property are a display of conspicous wealth. With all those miles of trees the campus felt very safe. That forest felt like a protective wall. Until a female student got raped. It badly shocked all of us. How could this happen? How could that happen here? The community did not handle the event well. Unfortunately as is all too common in trauma when the perpetrator is not available people lash out at a scapegoat instead. Evergreen was one of the most liberal colleges in the country and it had attracted a sizeable number of radical feminists. That part was good. What was not so good was that many of these women were taught that it is OK to be angry at men simply because they are men. So the response to the rape was to organize a take back the night march, but no men allowed. All men were strictly forbidden to even be on campus during the march. This caused deep trauma for many of the men. It did for me. Years later a close friend of mine confessed that he had (disobediently) chosen to stand in silent support along the march route and he received glare after glare of pure hatred. It hurt him deeply. He was not their enemy.

We seem to be hard wired to "other" each other. To treat each other as the enemy instead of as part of the solution. We are all too quick to put each other in boxes. And what a tragedy it is when all we see about a person is their boxes. The recent discussion of privilege is very useful in that it encourages, for example, white, cisgendered men like me to really get how much easier I have it than others. That is so true. And yet. No one fits neatly in a box. If all you bother to see about me are those words, "white", "cis-gendred", and "male" you have lost the wonder and awe of seeing someone fully. Of connecting with the mystery of what this person right here in front of you is. Remember our work is to expand people's hearts to include absolutely everyone, no kidding everyone. We won't get their using word boxes. We have to work hard against this tremendous temptation to "other" people.
