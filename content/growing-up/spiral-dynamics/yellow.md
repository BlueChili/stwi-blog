At some point we need to turn back to ourselves to find the Truth of things. We have absorbed the lessons of Green, and yet we are not at peace with ourselves. Green by itself won't get us to the healing we need. Green by itself won't heal the world. People insist on going their own selfish ways no matter how patiently we explain to them how stupid and evil they are. Then we try a little louder and slower, like you might to someone who does not speak English well. You. are. stupid. And. Evil! Huh. Still not working. YOU. ARE. STUPID. AND. EVIL!! How can they not understand that?!? Why don't they understand how stupid and evil they are?!? Maybe we are missing something? Perhaps there is a deeper level to go here? Maybe just maybe there is something more workable than dividing the world up into good and evil? But to convince you of that I need for you to go very deeply into yourself. Kind of like an odyssey of the soul. It can be a bit scary and painful, but there is also wonder and joy. It feels like Odysseus tied to his ship finally surrendering, cutting his ropes, and jumping off to join the Sirens. Giving up this life so that he can know what worlds come after.

And after we come up for air we are awakening all over again. We are right back to Beige level staring in awe at the moon. It is exactly the same and yet different because this time we have the lived experience of so many previous generations. At Green we might dabble with, for example, Native American traditions, but it is at this Yellow level where we truly get how much we can learn from these ancient cultures. And we find an incredible longing to go back to that way of life. But we can't go back. We scuttled our ships on the beach and the only way now is forward. Or die. The first step is to find our own strength and truth. It has to start here. Stop, breathe, spend time in nature and really look at ourselves. And what we find is that we are vast beyond imagining. There are so many ways to be human. And we welcome all of ourselves. Not just the bright pretty parts but the scary dangerous parts as well. Not just the perfect (and yes we welcome our own perfection!) but also the broken and hurting parts as well. All of us. The mother/father, shaman/hunter, empress/slave, monk/serf, scientist/worker, activist/follower, seeker. All of me. All of you. All of us.

Up to now I could point to well known, big historical shifts. You can argue that I am vastly over simplifying history (because in fact I am), but you can not really argue that there have not been powerful, historical shifts in human consciousness. This stage, though, is just getting started and therefore I don't have a lot of history to point at. There are more people waking up to this level than you would suspect and yet I don't think we have properly fully entered this stage. Who is at this level? Probably you. The simple fact that you have read this far means you are at least are willing to look beyond the limitations of Green. Welcome!

Each stage had some organization that pulled people into it. What is pulling people into Yellow? The biggest pull right now is from Medicine (psychedelics) work. There are many paths that can lead to a Yellow awakening, but the most popular seems to be Medicine work. If you choose to do this work do it with an experienced guide. And please read [How to Change Your Mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Change_Your_Mind#:~:text=8%20.P65%202018-,How%20to%20Change%20Your%20Mind%3A%20What%20the%20New%20Science%20of,New%20York%20Times%20best%2Dseller.). Michael Pollan (presumably without knowing about Spiral Dynamics) does a superb job of explaining to people mostly at the Green level what it is like to explore Yellow. People who are still at Orange are not ready to go straight to Yellow because their god of Reason is a jealous god that will not accept any other sources of Truth. But at Green people start to get a glimmer that there are other paths to Truth and maybe just maybe Medicine is something worth investigating as a path of growth not just healing.

## Second Tier

Something different happens at this level than all the other levels. Spiral Dynamics calls this Yellow level the start of a whole new tier; the second tier. Unlike the first tier levels, second tier levels recognize that all the levels have their place within us. Each level has its own time and place. Up to this point emerging levels tended to hate the levels below them. But at second tier we stop the hating simply because it serves no purpose. Categorizing people as stupid and evil is mostly a waste of time, and we are busy trying to get stuff done. Yellow level wizards learn to work effectively with people at all the different levels.

An example of a Yellow wizard is Rick Doblin, founder of MAPS. He has skillfully managed to steer both MDMA therapy and mushroom therapy through rigorous FDA trials. MDMA therapy has already been granted "breakthrough" status and it is only a matter of time before both are fully approved medical treatments. People kind of take this for granted, but they forget the fanatical war on drugs mentality he has had to patiently contend with. And that he got the Trump administration to sign off on all of this.

Ken Wilber calls this second tier the Integral level. He points out that we no longer live in a separated world. The wisdom of all the traditions is available, and we should recognize that they all have valuable lessons. When we reach this tier we have a special responsibility to the world. We see a little clearer and further than others on certain matters. We start to see that all the levels have their own inherent logic and use, but also that each of the first tier levels has dangerous blindspots that have to be managed and navigated. It is an act of moral cowardice to not accept this responsibility. Global warming is real, and if not addressed could end up triggering a chain of events where billions die. Democracies quite often are overthrown by authoritarians and then there is great suffering and death. Some courses of action are better than others. To choose to not act is itself an act.

## Tick-Tock pendulum swings

Then there is what I call the tick-tock part of Spiral Dynamics. Clare Graves noticed very early on that people's primary focus flips back and forth between individual concerns (eg. self expression) and group concerns (eg. sacrifice for the group). There is a necessary tension between those two concerns, and as we go up in developmental levels we find ourselves alternating between first making individual expression more important and then back to making group building more important.  But each developmental stage is "higher" than the last so we are spiralling between these two poles. For now don't worry about the spiral so much as to realize that the levels alternate between a focus on the individual (tick) and a focus on the group (tock).

Beige woke us up as individuals - tick.  
Purple gathered us together as tribe -- tock.  
Red struck out towards individual Godhood -- tick.  
Blue brought us back to a community honoring Truth -- tock.  
Orange released us to find our rational truth -- tick.  
Green brought us back to protecting us all -- tock.  
Yellow, echoing Beige, steps deeply into individual discovery all over again (tick).  
But it doesn't end here. The next level will bring us back together once more -- tock.
