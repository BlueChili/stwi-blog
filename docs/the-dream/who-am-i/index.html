<p>Who am I to save the world? I am just this nobody on the internet. I don&rsquo;t have any particular expertise or credentials. There is no particular reason you should listen to me other than maybe I can get you to think. But in some ways this ordinariness is actually an advantage. It is so obvious I can&rsquo;t do this alone. We are going to have to do this together</p>
<p>To give this any chance of working I can&rsquo;t hold anything back. I need to bring in everything that I am. Not just the shiny parts I want to show to you, but all of my rage, sorrow and pain too. Not just the gifts that I have, but the broken hurting places too. All of me is sacred and holy. All is welcome and loved. And all by myself I am nothing. I have to somehow inspire you to bring in all of yourself. All of your joy and all of your pain. All of you is sacred and holy. All of you is welcome and loved. And together as we look out at the world we need to find a way to bring everyone, yes truly everyone into it. How could it be otherwise? We need all of us.</p>
<p>We all have our unique stories. The stories that have shaped us. The stories that are our gift to the world. Let&rsquo;s start with mine.</p>
<h2 id="explorer">Explorer</h2>
<p>My driving trait seems to be curiosity. I always, always want to dig deeper into the Truth of things.  Especially if it is hard. The greatest gift you can give me is to help me see a truth I have been hiding from myself. This is where I started. This drive to explore has taken me to many amazing places, most of them internal.</p>
<p>My purpose is to climb tall mountains and leap into worlds unknown to chart the course for others to follow. Let me unpack that a little. I&rsquo;m attracted to things that are challenging and hard. The hard work of climbing a mountain is more than worth it for the view. And again I&rsquo;m talking mostly about internal challenges. Then when you finally get to the top of the mountain you now have a choice. You can go back to your familiar world or you can jump off into the unknown to see what comes. Once I have discovered some new world inside of myself I typically feel called to leap into it to really experience it. Without knowing exactly what I might find. There is kind of a surrender required here.</p>
<p>When I was emerging from a very dark, hurting time in my life; a time when I wasn&rsquo;t even sure I wanted to continue living, I made my first sacred vow to myself. To make sure I honored that vow I changed my name. I did it to make sure I would never forget. It worked. I had known for a long time before that what the name would be because I am an explorer. &ldquo;Odysseus&rdquo; is the archetype of embarking on an odyssey.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m now coming into the final phase of my purpose.  I have climbed a number of mountains and leapt off of them. And truly I look at all the people who have gone so much farther than me and wonder who I am to try and talk about these mountains. But it is now time to do some charting. I have some things that are worth passing on. And in fact switching to this new role feels like yet another scary mountain to leap off of. We all have these beautiful, undiscovered worlds within us. Let me show you some of them.</p>
<h2 id="my-story">My Story</h2>
<p>When I was younger I was in a lot of emotional pain. The way I found myself out of that suffering was to do intense personal growth workshops. Those workshops (along with meditation) were one of the very few things that worked. I tried therapy with a few Freudian psychiatrists but their approach seemed (and still does frankly) like mostly nonsense. So personal growth workshops it was. And I did a lot of them. The month of my 50th birthday I did a particularly powerful workshop and I stepped into a lot of joy. I finally committed to fully loving myself and others. It was a big step deeper into an ongoing spiritual awakening, and brought me into a new phase of my life. Suddenly it was easy to go on a very strict, life-long Paleo diet because that was the most loving thing to do for myself. It is what worked best for my body. I felt much healthier. And then a few years later I did guided, psychedelic Medicine work with a therapeutic intent and went into even deeper joy. Most mornings I find myself in joy. Now that I am mostly out of suffering, my focus has shifted to service. I want to help people not just find their way out of suffering, but into their own joy. Oceans of love are right there waiting for all of us. Just begging to be let in. Somehow, someway I want to help people let at least some of that immense love in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m stepping into the Elder phase of life. I think this is a phase that humans are supposed to go through. A time when we start to reconcile with our inevitable death. It is a time when my own needs seem less and less important. I still, of course, have my ongoing work to do but what I want to focus on most in my remaining time is the health of the tribe. Before I die, I want to leave a world that works for my grand kids. A world that works for all of our grand kids.</p>
<p>And then there is my second sacred vow to love everyone, no exceptions, no kidding. People who really know me describe me as very love based. I find that description astonishing. It is true, but it is kind of like saying I am very oxygen based. Of course I am oxygen based! I am quite attached to breathing. But so are you! And just like we sometimes forget to stop and really let ourselves breathe, we also quite often forget to stop and let ourselves really love. To me it seems obvious that everything is Love. Everything. We come from Love and return to Love. You know this to be true. Yes really. There are maybe only fleeting moments when this was really clear to you, but then as we all do you forgot. The trick is to forget less and less. I promise you there is an immense amount of joy to be found in the remembering.</p>
<h2 id="community">Community</h2>
<p>Living in Japan and married to a Japanese woman really opened my eyes to community. I experienced culture shock twice in Japan. The first time was on first arriving there. Everything was so different, and I had never been to a truly foreign country before. It was a comparatively mild shock. The second, much bigger shock happened a year later just as my Japanese was starting to get good enough to give me a glimpse of how truly different the Japanese look at the world. I woke up to how I just assumed there was only one world view. I really thought everyone looked at the world the way Americans do. That is so not true! The Japanese do not view the world as a bunch of individuals making their way, they instead see the world through a much, much more group focus. The purpose of life is not just a selfish pursuit of individual happiness. I don&rsquo;t think either the American or Japanese perspective is wrong. From what I could tell there is a mix of profound benefits and costs to each. But what it did was to open my eyes to how differently people can view this world.</p>
<p>I have been involved in cohousing most of my life. Cohousing&rsquo;s goal is to save the world one neighborhood at at time. A bunch of people decide to live together so they as a group buy some land and hire a developer to build the houses. I&rsquo;ve lived now in two different cohousing communities, and I&rsquo;m eager to move into a third. Living in community just feels better. But most people don&rsquo;t know this. Americans in particular have forgotten how to get along with other people. We use our wealth to isolate ourselves. That isolation protects us from the inevitable conflict that arises when people live in more intimate connection. But then we end up so lonely. It is not worth it. We don&rsquo;t have to live so isolated. But it takes work. I noticed when people (including myself) move into cohousing there are a whole set of skills to learn. A deeper connection to community is something we all are longing for but have mostly forgotten how to do.</p>
<h2 id="personal-growth-mindset">Personal Growth Mindset</h2>
<p>I have a personal growth mindset. What do I mean by that? I believe that living is something that we can get better at. There is a real savor to getting more skillful with all the things that come. We contain vast multitudes. How we chose to be moment to moment is governed more than we realize by personal preference. There are areas within us that we feel more comfortable hanging out in. But it is possible to go to the other places even if we mostly chose not to. And it is perfectly OK to not venture into those other areas. But it is important to know that is a choice we are making.</p>
<p>I have experienced immense, astonishing change. When it happened, everything felt different and yet in some important ways nothing had changed at all. I was still me but now living in that bigger place of possibility. And just to be very clear my imperfections did not get wholly washed away in each transformation. What I call my &ldquo;bullshit&rdquo; is still very much here. It just weighs on me less and less, and I get increasingly skillful in navigating through it.</p>
<h2 id="spirituality">Spirituality</h2>
<p>My passion for following the Truth led me early on to fall in love with science. What I love best about it is its hard discipline. It demands so much. You are called on to abandon even your most cherished theories and models if new, contradictory evidence comes to light. This ability to admit you are wrong is so critical to getting to Truth.</p>
<p>I started out as an atheist, because of course I did. I was a scientific rationalist. Religion seemed mostly like superstitious nonsense. And yet there were these strong hints that maybe just maybe I was missing something. I tell my waking up story <a href="https://cosmosgame.github.io/save-the-world/other/my-waking-up">here</a>, but the key point is that when I got really honest with myself, I had to admit that I am deeply spiritual. We all are, but most of us tend to forget it. We have brief moments, maybe in nature, maybe at a birth or death, where we know that we are all part of something much, much bigger. But then we forget and fall asleep again. I was starting to wake up more. Not always &ndash; I would go long stretches before suddenly I would wake up again, and I would always be surprised. How could I possibly have forgotten this! How could I not always embrace this joy? Why would I ever forget this? But forget I did, and the cycle would continue. Gradually I started to forget less and less. There is so much joy here that it can be overwhelming and it took me awhile to learn to accept even a tiny fraction. But along with this joy comes a longing. I want other people to find this. I want others to step into the joy that is just there waiting for them. But how? How do I help people find this place within themselves? I just didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Then I found psychedelics. As I was coming back to normal space from my very first guided journey I knew I had finally found the answer. Medicine work, if properly done is a safe way to let people directly experience what I am talking about. This work is going to change the world. Why am I so confident about this? Because it already did once. The 1960&rsquo;s was a fascinating decade. It started out as a conformist continuation of the post war 1950&rsquo;s but ended up radically changing the world. Think of the difference between early Beatle songs like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/She_Loves_You">She Loves You</a> in 1963 to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_the_Walrus">I am the Walrus</a> in 1967. Only four years apart and yet these songs are in completely different worlds. And it started with psychedelics, like LSD and Peyote. This medicine is so powerful that it can cause damage if not treated with the proper respect. Many people hurt themselves and there was a strong backlash. But therapists have shown that if done with profound respect and care, psychedelic therapy enables life changing transformations. People who have struggled to heal for years and years are now finally finding their way to internal peace. I believe in this approach so much that I trained to become a Medicine Guide myself.</p>
<h2 id="software-engineer">Software Engineer</h2>
<p>While I was participating in all those workshops and having those spiritual breakthroughs I was ashamed of being a software engineer. It seemed like that kind of work is so different from what is actually useful. I thought the world needs more therapists and gifted workshop leaders, not more computer programmers. And it does. But the world needs many things right now. It turns out that engineers can offer something as well. I had an epiphany &ndash; my engineering mindset is what I have to offer the world. I am under no delusion that this is the only useful mindset. But it is a useful way of looking at the world. It looks like we might actually need more of it. I will talk about that next.</p>
