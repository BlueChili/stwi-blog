Here are the healing paths that I personally know and can recommend. At Yellow we all find the paths that best resonate with us, but I notice that many people seem to stick with just one or two paths. I encourage you to explore as many of the paths as you can find. Each is going to bring you an important gift that you would not get with any other path.

## Human Awareness Institute (HAI)

## Hakomi

## Medicine work

## Forest Bathing

## Buddhism

## Yet to be Explored

### Vision quests

### Art therapy
