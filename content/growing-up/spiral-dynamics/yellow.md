At some point we need to turn back to ourselves to find the Truth of things. We have absorbed the lessons of Green, and yet we are not at peace with ourselves. Green by itself won't get us to the healing we need. Green by itself won't heal the world. People insist on going their own selfish ways no matter how patiently we explain to them how stupid and evil they are. Then we try a little louder and slower, like you might to someone who does not speak English well. You. are. stupid. And. Evil! Huh. Still not working. YOU. ARE. STUPID. AND. EVIL!! How can they not understand that?!? Why don't they understand how stupid and evil they are?!? Maybe we are missing something? Perhaps there is a deeper level to go here? Maybe just maybe there is something more workable than dividing the world up into good and evil? But to convince you of that I need for you to go very deeply into yourself. Kind of like an odyssey of the soul. It can be a bit scary and painful, but there is also wonder and joy. It feels like Odysseus surrendering, cutting his ropes, and jumping off the ship to join the Sirens so that he could know what worlds come after dying in this one.

And after we come up for air we are awakening all over again. Just like at the very beginning when we were staring in awe at the moon (Beige level) and looking around at a world both separate and part of us, in this Yellow stage we awaken to that very same thing but this time at an even deeper level. Because this time we have the lived experience of so many previous generations. There are so many ways to be human. And we welcome all of ourselves. Not just the bright pretty parts but the scary dangerous parts as well. Not just the perfect (and yes we welcome our own perfection!) but also the broken and hurting parts as well. All of us. The mother/father, shaman, empress, monk, scientist, activist, seeker. All of me. All of you. All of us.

Up to now I could point to well known, big historical shifts. You can argue that I am vastly over simplifying history (because in fact I definitely am), but you can not really argue that there have not been powerful, historical shifts in human consciousness. This stage, though, is just getting started and therefore I don't have a lot of history to point at. There are more people waking up to this level than you would suspect and yet I don't think we have properly fully entered this stage. Who is at this level? Probably you. The simple fact that you have read this far means you are at least are willing to look beyond the limitations of Green. Welcome!

Each stage had something that pulled people into it. What is pulling people into Yellow? The biggest pull right now is from Medicine (psychedelics) work. Although there are many paths that can lead to a Yellow awakening, by far the most straight forward way to get there is to do Medicine work. But please do this work with an experienced guide. This topic is well covered by others so I don't want to spend a lot of time on it here. If you are new to the topic do yourself a favor and read [How to Change Your Mind] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Change_Your_Mind#:~:text=8%20.P65%202018-,How%20to%20Change%20Your%20Mind%3A%20What%20the%20New%20Science%20of,New%20York%20Times%20best%2Dseller.). Michael Pollan (presumably without knowing about Spiral Dynamics) does a superb job of explaining to people at the Green level what it is like to explore Yellow. People who are still at Orange are not ready to go straight to Yellow because their god of Reason is a jealous god that will not accept any other sources of Truth. But at Green people start to get a glimmer that there are other paths to Truth and maybe just maybe Medicine is something worth investigating as a path of growth not just healing.

## Second Tier

Something different happens at this level than all the other levels. Spiral Dynamics calls this Yellow level the start of a whole new tier; the second tier. Unlike the first tier levels, second tier levels recognize that all the levels have their place within us. Each level has its own time and place. Up to this point emerging levels tended to hate the levels below them. But at second tier we stop the hating simply because it serves no purpose. Categorizing people as stupid and evil is mostly a waste of time we are actually trying to get something done. Yellow level wizards learn to work effectively with people at all the different levels.

An example of a Yellow wizard is Rick Doblin, founder of MAPS. He has skillfully managed to steer both MDMA therapy and mushroom therapy through rigorous FDA trials. MDMA therapy has already been granted "breakthrough" status and it is only a matter of time before both are fully approved medical treatments. People kind of take this for granted, but they forget the fanatical war on drugs mentality he has had to patiently content with.  

Yellow is similar to Beige but at a higher level. Both levels have sort of the same "feel" to them though. In music you can have the two notes but at different octaves (up by 8) and even though the notes are different they sound kind of the same. Spiral Dynamics levels seem to work the same way. Second tier levels are not an octave (8) up but a hectave (6) from their corresponding first tier level. So Beige was the first awakening and Yellow is the second. And like Beige, Yellow is the start of something new and very big.

Ken Wilber calls this second tier the Integral level. He points out that we no longer live in a separated world. The wisdom of all the traditions is available, and we should recognize that they all have a valuable lesson for us. Those of us who have achieved this tier have a special responsibility to the world. We see a little clearer and further than others on certain matters. At this tier we start to see that all the levels have their own inherent logic and use, but also that each of the first tier levels has dangerous blindspots that have to be managed and navigated. It is an act of moral cowardice to not accept this responsibility to guide. Global warming is real, and if not addressed could end up triggering a chain of events where billions die. Democracies quite often are overthrown by authoritarians and then there is great suffering and death. Some courses of action are better than others. To choose to not act is itself an act.

## Tic-Toc pendulum swings

Then there is what I call the tick-tock part of Spiral Dynamics. Clare Graves noticed very early on that people's primary focus flips back and forth between individual concerns (eg. self expression) and group concerns (eg. sacrifice for the group). There is a necessary tension between those two concerns, and as we go up in developmental levels we find ourselves alternating between first making individual expression more important and then back to making group building more important.  But each developmental stage is higher than the last so we are spiralling between these two poles. For now don't worry about the spiral so much as to realize that there the levels alternate between a focus on the individual (tick) and a focus on the group (tock).

Beige level was all about waking up as an individual - tick.
Purple was gathering together as tribe -- tock.
Red was individuals reaching towards Godhood -- tick.
Blue brought us back to a community honoring Truth -- tock.
Orange let the individual free as a rational actor -- tick.
Green brought us back to protecting us all -- tock.
Yellow, echoing Beige, steps deeply into individual discovery all over again (tick).
But it doesn't end here. The next level will bring us back together once more -- tock.
