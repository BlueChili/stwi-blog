> I don’t think people are seeking the meaning of life as much as they are seeking the experience of being alive.”
Joseph Campbell

"Organicity" is an unfamiliar, awkward word, and I have to confess I initially resisted it. My partner especially dislikes it but try as we might we can't come up with an alternative. We really do need a new word here. Ignore what the dictionary might say, in this sense the word combines "organism" with "icity" to mean the nature of an organism. It focuses us on the living, natural organisms that we all are. We tend to skip right past that, but this principle brings us back over and over to the miracle of life. Brings us back to noticing what our living body is feeling and longing for. Living things are always healing. Always. Isn't that amazing? A doctor might set a broken bone, but then it is up to the body to do the healing. When a 17 year old girl who I was very close to died I was devastated. A wise grief counselor told me that we are never the same after our losses, but to know that we are always on a path towards healing. That was comforting to hear. She was reminding me to trust myself.

But quite often something is blocking us. When I stood in front of that workshop room struggling to make the commitment to lead a deep, rich, meaningful life, I was really stuck. The facilitator then asked the group, "Everyone who believes he deserves this please stand". And everyone stood. As I stood there sobbing something shifted inside me. I could feel it. Something in me that had been blocked was now flowing. That was a moment of organicity. I was still struggling with what I had to do next, but this internal knowing was driving me forward. Guiding me.

This getting unblocked is the core of Hakomi. Hakomi therapists helps us get to those deep, core beliefs we made when we got really, really hurt. They teach us to honor those beliefs because they got us through. We survived and it was a kind of genius. But we see now the cost is too high and maybe there is another way. What is this organism longing for? Trust that. What is holding us back? Work with that. What wants to happen next? Trust that internal knowing and follow it. For me as therapist this was quite humbling. I was not the healer. I was just the support crew. I had to surrender control -- it was a leap of faith to simply trust organicity and I struggled with it. It was surprisingly hard to simply ask my client "What wants to happen next?", and to trust that something may come to them or not and either way it was good. I had this mistaken notion that I needed to constantly direct things. But that is not how healing works -- it always comes from within. Again, organicity is the core of Hakomi.

But this is not just a Hakomi principle. Forest bathing guides know that it is the forest that holds the answers for their participants, they are just opening the door. The more than human world will provide exactly what is needed. People just need a little support to step into that other, liminal world that is just right there. Every organism innately knows what is best for it. And organisms need to be with each other. Forest bathing reintroduces us to that wider world of relationship. 

HAI also is grounded in organicity. HAI workshops immerse people into loving connection with themself and others. From that place of support and non-judgment people can discover what is blocking them and move past it. When they step up, usually naked to the microphone on Sunday there quite often is a sense of new worlds opening for them. HAI sets up an incredibly loving, safe environment and then steps back and waits for the magic to happen. This is organicity at work

 Are you ready to embrace change? I can't promise it won't hurt but it also can be very beautiful.
