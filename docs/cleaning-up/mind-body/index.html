<main><h1>Mind/Body</h1>
<p>We have this weird illusion that somehow our body is separate from our mind. As if they are separate things. What a strange story we tell ourselves. It is so not true. What happens in our body affects our Mind. What happens in our Mind affects our body. It is all one.
When we suffer a traumatic event we store that trauma somewhere in our body. In his book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Body_Keeps_the_Score">The body keeps the score</a>, the psychiatrist  Bessel van der Kolk talks about how when he started first started out as a therapist working with traumatized people, his profession didn&rsquo;t have much to offer. They didn&rsquo;t even really recognize that PTSD was a real thing. That has changed. In the second half of his book he talks about the many, many different and promising therapy options for traumatized people we have now. This is huge. Maybe for the first time since the start of Red empire we have the chance to finally stop that cycle of one generation passing it&rsquo;s trauma on to the next. And as different as these therapy options are they do share one thing &ndash; they share a way to help people connect their bodies back into the world.</p>
<p>I worked with a very, very traumatized young woman struggling to recover from extreme childhood PTSD. When she told me her history I would weep with horror &ndash; it was just too much. How could anyone possibly recover from that!? And she suspected that her crippling illnesses were all that trauma still livin on inside her. We used MDMA as sacred medicine and she had an amazingly rich journey. She discovered a nurturing, holy connection with her body and her face glowed with joy. Up until then her body had only been a source of pain, something she had to learn to manage and hold off. For as long as she could remember her body never had enough heat and was always cold. Now she had plenty. For over a year after that journey we simply did Hakomi to help her find her way back to her body. Simply remembering her sacred journey was all that it usually took. This discovery changed her life. She still had her medical challenges, but now she was able to step into the world in a much bigger way.</p>
<p>And then there is sex. Our society does not handle sex very well. Most of us have unprocessed shame about our bodies and sex. We have a lot of healing to do here &ndash; sex is yet another way we are disconnected from our bodies.  But sex is so fundamental. We can not get to the world we want without reclaiming its sacred nature. We need to relearn how to touch each other in a deeply intimate way. In my first HAI workshop I found myself naked, straddled with another naked man and stroking his face with deep love. It was very hard. I had never done that with a man before. It was so clear to me that this was not sexual, but it was so intimate. I had never been so intimate with someone without it leading to sex. And I had a big aha! moment &ndash; sex and intimacy are different. Maybe I might have agreed with that intellectually before, but now I got it all the way in my body. Got that deep down I had thought that the only way to true intimacy was sex. What a limiting belief that was! It meant that the only possible source of intimacy I could have was with my wife. No wonder I was so desperate for sex. Yes, I had a strong sex drive but what was really driving me was my desperate need for intimacy. And our sex life was not working &ndash; that hurt so deeply and I was angry about it. When I got home from the workshop a miracle occured. In one wild moment I was able to let go all of that anger and hurt. I really got that not having sex didn&rsquo;t mean she didn&rsquo;t love me. I knew that she did. Sex and intimacy are different.</p>
<p>So how do we teach people that? HAI workshops are an excellent way. HAI works very hard to get people deeply connected to their bodies. It is one of the major reasons why HAI invites people to take their clothes off. It is why in HAI exercises people spend so much time stroking each other. The exercises are designed to help heal some of the wounding around our bodies or sex. By releasing some of that shame we can more fully inhabit our bodies. And again, we can not get to the world we want without working through all this shame and ignorance. But most people won&rsquo;t even consider taking a workshop once they find they are mostly naked. That is such a nonstarter for most people. The other thing that scares people away is the deep eye gazing exercises. So maybe we need to come up with a non-naked, milder version of HAI to meet people where they are at.</p>
<p>Medicine work takes us into our bodies in a way most of us have never experienced. Takes us into that wild subconscious that we up to now have only seen glimpses of. And the one thing we guides tell our clients is to try as much as possible to surrender to the wisdom of the medicine and their bodies. Trust that what needs to happen will happen. That brings us to our next principle.</p>
