## The Plan for the Plan

Before diving into the specifics of the plan, let's take a moment and review the overall structure of the plan. What are the parts and how do they fit together.

### The Goal

What do we truly want for this world? What would light us up all the way? I suggested earlier that we don't have to overthink this. Let the children guide us. And in particular, let our inner child guide us. We already know what we dream for the world, we just have to dare to believe it is possible. On some beautiful day the world is going to wake up in love and joy. But we can't just jump straight there from where we are now. This is where the work is.

### Recognize the Pain

 First, I suggest we need to better understand the world. Why do people act like they do? It turns out that groups of people have very different world views. How did that come to be? What does the past suggest for the future? Knowing that people think very differently than us can we shift our hearts to forgive their transgressions? Knowing that the world has had major shifts in the past, can we embrace and encourage the next one that wants to happen?

### Step fully into the pain

And always after you look outwards you next need to turn within. Where do I fit into all of this? Who do I need to be in order to best serve the world?  I hope to wake people up to a vocation of service, but most people are so stuck in pain that they can't even imagine that yet. It is only after someone has at least taken the first steps on the healing path before they can even consider service. The good news is that service work can be incredibly healing, and is a healing path all on its own. But first we have to have a plan to heal all these people. How can we do that?

### Awaken to something bigger

It turns out the deeper healing comes when we surrender to something larger than ourself. After we acknowledge that yes in fact we are in a lot of pain, we then work on accepting the pain. Fully embracing it and accepting it. And if the right kind of support is there we can learn that this pain is a path of transformation. No guarantees on this one sadly, but there is a beauty and joy that can shine through the cracks of the deepest suffering. And that light illuminates the path that we ultimately need to follow. But again we don't get to jump straight there. We first need to look both outwards and inwards before we can merge those into something even bigger. And then we circle back to where we started -- that childlike sense of awe and wonder. That knowing that the world can be very, very beautiful but it takes a magic wish to start it all.
