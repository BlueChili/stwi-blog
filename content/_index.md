# Welcome!

Thank you so much visiting this web site! I am deeply grateful that you did! Your support and feedback is precious to me -- it will help me create something of value. I won't get there without you. Seriously.

My goal is to first save the world, because it needs saving. But we have to go way beyond just that. Climate change is now irreversible. There is no going back. We are going to have to learn to share a very different, challenging world. Simply to survive we now have no choice but to learn to care about all of us. Some will live in areas that benefit from climate change and many will not. We will have to learn to share everything. But this urgent necessity is also an opportunity. We could chose to create a world of our dreams. It really is possible. I hope to convince you to join me. I need allies. This world needs allies.

For thirty years I have watched global warming. Back in the 90's environmentalists like myself knew a disaster was coming. The science was clear. And I did nothing. Each decade the scientific reports kept on coming back consistently reporting that it was even worse than we feared. And I did nothing. The scientific reports are so bad now I can not make myself read them. It hurts too much. If you know how to read them, you know the scientists are actually screaming in anguish to an uncaring populace. And I did nothing.

No longer.

My daughter is learning about how bad the situation is at school. Our children understand the reality of our situation better than we do. She asked me if it is OK to have children. And I had to really think about it. I found myself bargaining with God. Maybe her children will be OK? But then she asks me what about her children's children? And what about all future children? And the answer is I do not know.

What I do know is that I will not do nothing for another thirty years. The world needs even someone as ordinary as me. No matter how hard it gets I can not imagine anything more painful than to have a conversation with my grandchildren thirty years from now and have to confess to them that yet again for another thirty years I did nothing.

Fortunately, while I did (mostly) nothing others have been hard at work. They have done so much and yet here we are. On our own we can only get so far. All the urgent projects that people are working on such as Black Lives Matter and Social Justice are vitally important. But we need to understand that we are all working on the same project. All this work shares the very same problem -- how do we get people into a bigger, more compassionate place? If we can get people there, the world changes in an instant. But that is very big work and it will require all of us. So even as we continue to do our separate work we also need to coordinate on an even bigger dream -- saving the world together.  

This site is a home for this bigger dream. For big problems like this we need the collective intelligence and wisdom of as many people as we can get. This site is set up to encourage and enable people to collarborate. Because we have work to do. We need to come up with something very new. To paraphrase Einstein, you can not solve problems with the same consciousness that created them. We can not just keep on doing what we have been doing and expect things to just take care of themselves. We have learned so much, now it is time to put all that learning to use. We don't have much time -- we are on a deadline now.

For those thirty years I watched and wondered. What are the deeper causes of our problems? What is it that prevents people from opening their hearts wider and wider? What would it take on a practical level to save the world? I have been looking for people with workable answers. And they are out there! Now we need to bring these separate teachings together into an integrated whole. First we must cultivate these integrated teachings in ourselves because of course it has to start there, but then once we find our feet we can then look out to others and ask, "What is that we want to create together?"

I have read that the best way to get an answer on the internet is to answer a question wrong even if it is in answer to your own question. That seems to provoke people to respond. It seems to work. So in that spirit I am going to provide my own answer here. If you have a better solution -- great! you have no idea how eager I am to hear it.

What do we need to make the world of our dreams?

### A Better Story

We need a better shared story. Modern people tend to forget how much our stories define us. The stories we are telling ourselves right now cast us as helpless victims. That is not working. Our stories right now don't help us understand the historical reasons for why things are the way they are. That leaves us unable to make effective change. But it doesn't have to be like that. We can choose to tell ourselves a different story. A story that gives us courage. A story that lets us shake off this trance of helplessness and take on the task of saving the world with a cheerful heart. Most important this story will provide us hope. Hope that something huge might just want to awaken soon.

### Wider Healing

When I am hurting, my personal world collapses down. All I can manage is just to make it through the day. Collectively the world is hurting. Most people are in too much pain to do the bigger work. We need to help them get out of their pain. There have been some exciting breakthroughs in therapy that need to reach more people. When people emerge out of pain, incredible things happen. We need to spread this healing to everyone that needs it.

### A Bigger Dream

Our way of living does not work. Once we understand our place in a bigger story and then step out of our pain that makes room for change. Radical change. I don't yet know exactly what this is going to be. I will need your help for this part. But imagine us coming together as a loving, supportive tribe that works together. That will be the core of it. And it will feel really good to be part of. We will know it is working when people flock to it because it is so compelling and even fun.

Together, we will start telling ourselves a different story than we have been. That this could actually work. Work well enough so that we can maybe start to dream a bigger dream than we have so far. Start to dream of what is possible if only enough of us could get out of our pain and step into the joy of service. And from there maybe we can step into a whole world of joy. Why not?

I can't guarantee that we will get there. The possibility of failure is always very real, but I would not be creating this website if I did not truly, truly believe it is possible. The very first step is to hope. Are you willing to take that risk with me?

To care? I think I do know what I'm asking of you. Please join me anyways.
