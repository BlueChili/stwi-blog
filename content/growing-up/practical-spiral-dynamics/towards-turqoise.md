I initially hoped that simply telling people the Spiral Dynamics story would wake them up to Turquoise. But nope. Most people are not quite ready yet. I feel like a popcorn kernel that has popped a little earlier than the rest. I hope and pray that it is just a matter of time before the rest of the kernels start popping so I can nestle in with them, but in the meantime it looks like I have some work to do.

I want people to end up where I am. How did I get to this point? I found a number of wise schools to guide me. I was asked to seriously commit to a rich, deeply fulfilling life. And I did. I now awaken each morning to joy. Then I was taught to find something  bigger than myself, and then finally I woke up to what I am called to do. This is a powerful path to walk. Please walk with me.

Do you remember the initial plan?

* Growing Up
* Cleaning Up
  * Healing up
  * Wising Up
* Waking Up
* Showing Up

We have been working on Growing Up. I started here because without a coherent story we are stumbling around blind. Blue religions tell us to just trust God and everything will be fine. It won't be. Orange scientists understand global warming but not people. Green activists understand the deep injustices of the world, but not how to fix it. Not really. Yellow seekers see no alternative but to watch the world burn. It doesn't occur to them that there is tremendous power in numbers.

We need a story that encourages us to bring all of ourselves forward not just one part. I hope you got my love for all the stages. Some stages I still struggle with. For example I have huge issues with authoritarian Red. The myths of Blue can drive me crazy. Green's group-think and intolerance scares me. And Purple seems so hard to fully understand. But I am committed to loving and embracing people in whatever stage they are at; Spiral Dynamics or otherwise. And that includes myself. What I don't love in others is what I don't love in myself. So about those stages and people that I don't fully accept yet? I have some more growth work to do. We all do. 

Cleaning Up is about creating a deep, rich fulfilling life. We use the closely related yet different practices of Healing Up and Wising Up to help us get there. We first step back into Beige to find out bodies again. That is our Healing Up work. We next discover the incredible wisdom and power of the group coming together as Purple. That is our Wising Up work.

Waking Up is about stepping into something bigger than ourselves. This is the other side of Purple -- it can awaken us to spirit.

Showing Up is about figuring out what we came to Earth to do. And once we get really clear on that we will also get clear that we can not do it alone. We need others to wake up to what it is they are here for and then for them too to realize they can't get there on just their own. We are going to have to get there together. We need to come together as one in community.

This place of sacred community lets us bring all parts of us forward. We bring our vibrant animal natures (Beige). We create sustainable, loving community (Purple). We step into those incredibly challenging conversations and confrontations (Red). We commit to those wild dreams of something greater than ourselves (Blue). We honor the beautiful Truth of science and reason to see more clearly (Orange). We heal the wounds of the oppressed and reclaim our natural equality (Green). We hone our Spiral wizadry to meet people where they are and actually get stuff done (Yellow). We wake up to our full strength and then look out to others (Turqoise). And then just maybe we can step into that [more beautiful world our hearts know is possible](https://charleseisenstein.org/books/the-more-beautiful-world-our-hearts-know-is-possible/).

Next step? Cleaning Up
