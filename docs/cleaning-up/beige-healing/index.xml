      <description>Late in my sophomore year in high school I started getting horrible, huge acne cysts on my face that left permanent, deep scars. I went from one of the cuter boys to one of the uglier just like that. I felt very vulnerable, so I stared into the mirror and told myself over and over &amp;ldquo;You are ugly&amp;rdquo;. I was trying to toughen myself . This got all the way in because it was actually done with loving intent &amp;ndash; I didn&amp;rsquo;t want anyone to be able to hurt me.</description>

      <description>It turns out that I could have avoided those horrible acne cysts simply by changing my diet. My hometown happened to have one of the very few dermatologists in the country who understood that. If I had gone to him right away I would have been spared most of my trauma. The problem was that I have a particular kind of allergy to milk fat. And I was consuming a lot of it — I was drinking close to a gallon of milk a day (growing teenage boy) not to mention all the pizza and ice cream.</description>

      <description>When I was in college I went to the Zen center at Green Gulch north of San Francisco to meditate for a week. I knew how rigorous it was going to be so I diligently practiced zazen until I could sit for almost an hour in perfect stillness. I was quite proud of my ability. At the zen center we sat so quietly that even if someone swallowed you could hear it so I tried to not even do that.</description>

      <description>We tend to hold our bodies and minds as separate things. They are not. And if our body is suffering we are not up for anything other than simple survival; we certainly are not up for saving the world.
Hakomi works with the common traumas people share. One of the most common is insecure attachment. If a child does not feel secure in their relationship to their caregiver they are traumatized.</description>

      <description>I don’t think people are seeking the meaning of life as much as they are seeking the experience of being alive.” Joseph Campbell
&amp;ldquo;Organicity&amp;rdquo; is an unfamiliar, awkward word, and I have to confess I initially resisted it, but we really do need a new word here. Ignore what the dictionary might say, in this sense the word combines &amp;ldquo;organism&amp;rdquo; with &amp;ldquo;icity&amp;rdquo; to mean the nature of an organism. It focuses us on the living, natural organisms that we all are.</description>

      <description>While I was writing this section, I had a urinary infection that made it painful to pee. I kept on ignoring and ignoring it for two weeks. Finally it got so painful even I could no longer ignore it so I went into urgent care and got a prescription that cleared me up pretty much in one day. Why did I wait so long? Now with the infection gone I realize how much it was weighing on me.</description>

      <description>We can have our ecstatic moments, but what really matters is what we bring back to our daily life. When starting a Medicine journey, quite often we struggle to surrender to the medicine, but once we do we almost always eventually end up in a beautiful spot. Maybe we wrap our arms around an angel and blast to another planet, or maybe we die and once we get past that horror find ourself in a world of peaceful joy where our painful body no longer troubles us.</description>

“The hardest to learn was the least complicated” Indigo Girls
Please consider Aaron Stark&amp;rsquo;s story about how he almost became a school shooter. What saved him? A friend&amp;rsquo;s undemanding love. The friend wasn&amp;rsquo;t trying to fix him, he just wanted to spend time with him. Even though Aaron had lied to him and stolen from him, his friend was still there.</description>

      <description>For each of the stages I am going to ask you to test yourself and then I will suggest homework. For Beige I am going to mainly suggest reading books. If that sounds like too much please consider using audio books. The beauty of audio books is that you can listen to them for 15 minutes in the car while driving somewhere. I got through a couple of the suggested books below that way.</description>
