      <description>How do we know what color level someone or a group is at? To figure this out there are some questions we need to answer:
 Are they more individual focused (tick) or group focused (tock)? What do they know to be True? What are they willing to die for?  Let&amp;rsquo;s go through the color levels again, but this time asking those questions.
Beige (FirstAwakening) At Beige focus is on the individual family (tick).</description>

      <title>Blindspots</title>

      <description>Everyone has blind spots. Except me. I don&amp;rsquo;t have any. This deeply amuses me because it is so obviously false, and yet there is a part of me that really believes it. After all I can&amp;rsquo;t see my own blind spots so obviously I don&amp;rsquo;t have any, right? In other words, I don&amp;rsquo;t know what I don&amp;rsquo;t know. But this is true for everyone. We all can not see our own blind spots by definition!</description>

      <title>Shadows</title>

      <description>All of the stages come with both gifts and shadows. I will touch on the shadow side first. The part that is hurting and not working well. The part that is causing harm in the world.
Beige The shadow version of this stage is what happens when we collapse down to survival mode. Only me and mine matter. Just like one of those Zombie apocalypse everyone else is just a monster to be dealt with.</description>

      <title>Gifts</title>

      <description>Each stage brings a crucial gift. But we can have blindspots here too. For example, Green hates Red and can see nothing useful in the Red mindset whatsoever. And similarily Red hates Green. To be sure, Green is not wrong. We are in fact living in a world of systemic racism and sexism. But what Green (and I have to admit I too) struggle with is to realize there actually is a gift that Red brings.</description>

      <title>Putting Spiral Dynamics to work</title>

      <description>Hopefully I have convinced you that Spiral Dynamics is a useful story. But how does it help us? How do we work more skillfully with all the stages? Let&amp;rsquo;s take one more spin through all the stages to consider what needs to be done.
Beige So many people are collapsed down to the survival level. They are leading quiet lives of desperation. Just barely able to make it each day. Sometimes this is because they are brutally poor.</description>

      <title>Towards Turqoise</title>
      <link>https://cosmosgame.github.io/save-the-world/growing-up/practical-spiral-dynamics/towards-turqoise/</link>

      <description>When I first started telling people the Spiral Dynamics story I hoped it would wake them up to Turquoise all by it self. But nope. Most people are not quite ready yet. I feel like a popcorn kernel that has popped a little earlier than the rest. I hope and pray that it is just a matter of time before the rest of the kernels start popping so I can nestle in with them, but in the meantime it looks like I have some work to do.</description>
