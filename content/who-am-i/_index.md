## Who am I?

Before I go into the plan, I think it is useful maybe even necessary to talk a little about myself first. Who is this person begging you to hope and care? What particular viewpoint am I coming from?

I'm a 58 year old white male living in the Bay Area. I have two kids (Ulysses and Jaiya) from separate marriages and they are the world to me. I've been a software programmer most of my life, and I love programming. I'm book smart so I did well academically. I am a seeker of Truth. When I was younger I was in a lot of pain. The way I found myself out of that pain was doing intensive personal growth workshops. It was the only thing that seemed to work. I tried a few Freudian psychiatrists but their approach seemed (and still does frankly) like mostly nonsense. So personal growth workshops it was. And I did a lot of them. The month of my 50th birthday I did a particularly powerful workshop and I stepped into a lot of joy. I finally committed to fully loving myself and others. It was a kind of spiritual awakening, and brought me into a lot of joy. And then a few years later I did Medicine work and went into even deeper joy. Now that I am mostly out of pain, my focus has shifted to service. I want to help people not just find their way out of pain, but into their own joy. It is right there waiting for all of us. Just begging to be let in. Somehow, someway I want to help that happen. After taking a number of trainings I am just now embarking on a side practice as Medicine guide. I am also deepening my meditation practice and after some more trainings I plan on becoming a meditation teacher.

And then there is my spiritual awakening. People who really know me describe me as very love based. I find that description astonishing. It is like saying I am very oxygen based. Of course I am oxygen based! I am quite attached to breathing. But so are you! And just like we sometimes forget to stop and really let ourselves breathe, we also quite often forget to stop and let ourselves really love. To me it seems obvious that everything is Love. Everything. We come from Love and return to Love. You know this to be true. Yes really. There are maybe only fleeting moments when this was really clear for you, but then as we all do you forgot. The trick is to forget less and less. I promise you there is an immense amount of joy to be found in the remembering.

So why talk about myself? Because this site is meant to be a practical example of what I am asking for. The world I hope to help create is going to require all of me. The engineer, the personal growth explorer, and the spiritual dreamer. All of me. But of course all by myself I can accomplish nothing. So I need to inspire you to bring in all of yourself. What unique combination of gifts are you for the world? How can we deepen and strengthen all that you have to offer?. We need all of you. And together I want to create a world that truly welcomes and celebrates the wild diversity and richness of the world. We need all of us.

While I was participating in all those workshops and having those spiritual breakthroughs I was always a little ashamed of being an engineer. It seemed like something so different from what the world needed. I thought the world needed more therapists and gifted workshop leaders, not more programmers. And it does. But the world needs many things right now. It turns out that engineers can offer something as well. In fact when I looked closer, there are a surprising number of things that programmers can teach the world. I talk about that in a separate post [TODO -- link to side document], but the key thing to know here is that I bring an engineer's practical, result oriented mindset to this project. I know the critical importance of theory, but I also know not to bring too much in. I have done a lot of reading, and I am happy to do a lot more if you have suggestions, but all that reading needs to be distilled down into the simplest and most practical plan that can work. And software engineers know how critically important it is to get feedback because software gets better and better the more eyes you put on it. And the best way to harness that phenomenon? Open Source.


## Open Source

More people should be aware of the open source movement. It is kind of a big deal. I've been watching it with fascination from the beginning. In the 1990's it was not at all clear that it would end up completely conquering the  world. But it did. Much of the software that you are using at this very moment is open source. It is built into the very foundations of the internet. Open Source out competed fierce capitalistic competitors because it is a better way of collaborating. It is the only instance that I know of where communism won. No one owns open source software; people freely donate their time to it as a gift to the world. Ideas work best when they are free. And frameworks work best when many people have taken a serious look at them and offered improvements. But despite this idealism open source exists to be of use. Not all contributions are accepted. It is not like the wikipedia where there are endless, wasteful edit wars over controversial topics. Open source tends to avoid all that and stays focused on delivering value. And if it doesn't some other open source project comes to replace it.

Open source does not have to be just for software. I propose that this plan to save the world should be an open source project. So how does that work? This website is hosted on Github, which is where many open source projects live. Every aspect of this site is open to inspection and review. Github supports this kind of collaboration through an intuitive interface. The Github UI is meant to be accessible even to people who are not strongly technical.

There are three main ways to interact with this site

### Comments

Please, please leave a comment below. Even just to say Hi. You have to create an account to do this, but that is to prevent bots from spamming the comments. My apologies for making you do that, but it is necessary. Unprotected websites get spammed really bad. And I hope you do register because I so want to hear your thoughts. This is the easiest level and I hope everyone takes advantage of this.

### Issues

All open source project have issues (aka bugs) that they are working on. If you see something that needs to be fixed, or have a suggested improvement, please switch over to the GitHub section of this site (notice that there are links everywhere to do that). Then find the "Issues" tab and type in your request. This takes a little bit more effort than simply adding a comment, but it makes it much easier to track what are the main things that need work. It also lets other people comment on the issue. You can also track when the fix was made. This is the next level of involvement in the project. I would love it if you simply posted an issue just for practice.

### Pull requests

A "Pull request" aka (PR) is when someone makes changes to their local version of the project and now are requesting that this change get merged into the master version shared by everyone. It is like you have a copy of a shared word document and you have added a couple of extra pages. And now you want to merge your changes into the shared copy that everyone using. In open source this is not automatic. Whoever is maintaining that part of the project needs to approve each and every PR. If the changes are simple (eg. spelling and grammar fixes) the PR will likely be merged right away. If the PR makes big structural changes, there likely will be a bunch of back and forth conversation before the PR eventually gets merged. Go ahead and try it. You are not going to break anything. If you are not serious about your proposed changes just let me know in the PR description.


## Goals

In order to give feedback, it helps to know what are the basic goals. If you find that some part of this site does not match these goals please let me know - it is a bug that needs to be fixed.

### Simplicity

I deeply value your time. I promise not to waste it. There is a lot to cover here, but I will only bring in the  most important points. There are lots of fun tangents that can be visited as side topics, but the goal is to focus on finding the simplest thing that can work. Every idea will be expressed as simply and clearly as possible. If you don't understand a concept it is my fault not yours. Let me know. If you think I'm wasting time on something, then you might have found an important bug (or at the very least I am not explaining well enough why it is essential).

### Practical

The goal is to create something practical. Something that can actually change the world. Getting the theory right is incredibly important, but on the main path we don't want to bring in any more theory than is strictly necessary. People like myself can go off and do the readings, but then we need to come back here ready to share the useful nuggets that can be put to work.

### Kaizen

Kaizen means constant on-going improvement. It is always possible to grow and learn. You should be a bit skeptical of initial versions of this site, but over time as more people contribute and comment the site will grow and mature. Kaizen is a very open source concept. It is also very Japanese. I spent a lot of time in Japan and was deeply influenced by its culture. You are never done with the work -- there is always more to be done. And there is a deep joy in that.

### Self evident

Nothing written here is meant to be taken on faith. You are encouraged to find the truth of everything within yourself. Please note, though, that the request is that you search for this truth in all of yourself. Some people tend to only look for truth in their heads, others only tend to look for it in their hearts or spirit. The request is that you look for truth in all parts of yourself, especially the parts that maybe you don't typically search.  This is especially true for spirituality.  You might be skeptical about this topic, but please know that the expectation is that any claim made here is meant to be validated by your own internal experiments. It has to be that way. Only you can find the truth for yourself.

## Next steps

OK. So I hope you have a better idea of how and why I have set up this site. My biggest hope is that this site becomes much bigger than me. But I have to start somewhere so I start with myself. I'm so looking forward to seeing what you bring in.

Let's get back into the plan shall we? In the next section I'm going to briefly recap the plan for the plan, and then it's time to finally dive in.
