* Manchester by the sea
* balance against narcissm
* creativity

I recently watch a movie called Manchester by the Sea. The movie has amazing acting and is quite well done. But I don’t recommend it. At all. I think the movie is quite harmful and should have strong warning labels on it. Why am I so upset about this movie? Because it portrays deeply, deeply traumatized people stumbling around causing harm to themselves and others without any recognition that it doesn’t have to be like that. The movie perpetuates the harmful story that there is nothing you can do about deep trauma. This is so not true!
