      <description>Color Nickname Social construct Cause worth dying for  Beige FirstAwakening Family and Kin My family   In the very beginning, our ancestors somehow had the first awakening. We stepped into a level of consciousness higher than other animals. Imagine a caveman dad sitting on a rock with his son looking up at the full moon. The son says &amp;ldquo;Dad, what is that?&amp;rdquo;, And the dad says, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know.</description>

      <description>Color Nickname Social construct Cause worth dying for  Purple KinSpirits Tribe The sacred ground   Something amazing happened about 30,000 to 40,000 years ago. We see it in the cave paintings of the time. When we stop and really look at this powerful art we can not help but be moved. These people were just like us. This was clearly the next step up in consciousness. From smallish bands we formed bigger tribes and we became bad-asses.</description>

      <description>Color Nickname Social construct Cause worth dying for  Red PowerGods Kingdoms,Empire My king. Honor   Archeological records show that the first agricultural communities continued the egalitarian traditions of hunter gatherers. Everyone was (mostly) equal still. But populations shot up at this point and things started to get much more complicated. We stratified into layers of society. And then a new thing arose. We chose to become as Gods.</description>

This is what we wake up to in the Blue level. We surrender to something bigger than us. And that surrender brings a profound, sweet purpose and meaning to life. Before this, Truth was localized. Whoever had the most power and authority determined what Truth was.</description>

This was a turn away from the church and God towards looking for the Truth within. From this stage emerged modern science, capitalism, and democracy. America&amp;rsquo;s Declaration of Independence is a quintessential expression of Orange:</description>

 &amp;ldquo;I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed - we hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal.</description>

We have absorbed the lessons of Green, and yet we need more. Green by itself won&amp;rsquo;t get us to the healing we need. Green by itself won&amp;rsquo;t heal the world.</description>

      <description>Theory is a great place to start, but my goal is a practical one. How do we put this theory to use? I think Valerie Kaur&amp;rsquo;s Revolutionary Love Project shows one way.
Please watch her Ted talk. It is a great review of everything I have talked about so far. I sincerely doubt that she is aware of Spiral Dynamics, but that makes the video even more compelling. She takes us through all the levels and emerges in a call to unite to save the world.</description>

      <description>This is not done yet. Here is the outline of what I want to cover:
 Software engineer path  Radical truth  Running in debug mode Embrace when you are wrong Measuring   Learning to be wrong  It is a practice Needs to be supported OK to aspire to excellence anyways   Check your assumptions  debugging leads to this examine sources of truth   Dealing with complexity  simplify layers scrum  negotiating complexity not everyone has to be a software expert     Deep dive  Five whys Failure without blame Factoring in that humans are failable   Flow  Cure for sensitivity -hiding out in crystalline forests Teaches possibility of joy  joy based life     Request For Comments (RFC) Models Open source  Shared libraries Forking Not all opinions are equal      </description>

      <description>I love movies where the reluctant heroes are desperately trying to save the world against what seem impossible odds. First they overcome their fears and limitations, and then they commit. Then they work through their bitter squabbles and commit to each other. I want to be like them. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping you do too, because the world is in desperate need of heroes right now.

      <description>But first we need a plan. Our current approach is not working. There are many things not working, but let me focus on climate change because it is a huge problem. Emissions keep on going up. World wide agreements are made, but never for enough and emissions keep on going up. Environmentalists pin their hope on elections but then the other party gets elected and dismantles previous work. And emissions keep on going up.</description>

      <description>Let me start with a simple question. Why do we think the Civil War actually solved anything? Did that war really change hearts and minds? I don&amp;rsquo;t think so. Not really. Imagine the end of the U.S. Civil War. The North has just crushed the South using brutal, total war: Sherman&amp;rsquo;s March to the Sea. The South surrenders with the bitter realization that the North will stop at absolutely no unspeakable atrocity in order to totally crush them.</description>

      <description>This site is meant for people who are excited by the bigger dream of what we are all collectively waking up to. Waking up to finding their bigger purpose of service. Service coming not from a place of self-sacrifice but instead from listening to the call for the deeper joy that is struggling to be born but needs some midwives. Please join me. I can&amp;rsquo;t do this alone.</description>

      <description>During the Trump presidency it felt like political commentators were crashing around their bedroom at night trying to get to the bathroom. Not really recognizing what they were bumping into. For example many focused too much on Trump without realizing he just represented the yearning of a huge number of Americans. Many others viewed him as a uniquely American problem, and failed to see that there has been an absolute plague of Authoritarian governments in the world recently.</description>
