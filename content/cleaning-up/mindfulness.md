Healing revolves around mindfulness. We encourage people to stop, take a breath, and really pay attention to what is going on with themselves. As people start to realize what a truly safe space they are in they feel safer to start exploring some of their scarier places.  We gently remind them to close their eyes and really get in touch with how they are feeling. This is a core method.

We tend to get caught up in the strong currents of our emotions. The first step is mindful awareness of what is swirling around inside us. But then the next step is to get deeply curious. Why am I so angry? My goodness there is so much anger flowing through my body! I wonder what is going on here? What beliefs do I have about what just happened? Both HAI and Hakomi make a point to encourage people to get really curious about what is going on within themselves. Curiosity takes us out of judgment and opens up new possibilities. Do I really need to get so angry about that?

It is so easy to forget to do this. Constant reminders to “get really curious…” are needed. This switches us away from judgment and blame to simply wanting to understand.
