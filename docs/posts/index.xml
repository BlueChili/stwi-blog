      <description>Buddhists have a process called RAIN that can get you unblocked and back into healing and growth. It turns out that Hakomi uses almost the exact same process, but they go a few steps further. I’ve tacked ING onto the end to address that. Note that I’m not quite exactly getting the Hakomi extra steps right, but at least it is the gist of it. And I do dearly love the cuteness of the expanded acronym.</description>

      <title>“Ugly”</title>

      <description>It is incredibly hard to be ugly. This pain of it is not really acknowledged in our society. Having at least reasonable looks is a privilege. I spent much of my life as ugly and it was really hard. My mother told me over and over that I was very attractive. But when my sister was having a fancy wedding, I got a call from both my mom and my sister to make sure that I would be OK with getting serious makeup work done before the wedding pictures were taken.</description>

      <description>Everything is God (the Universe) and God (the Universe) is love&amp;quot;
Does this ring true to you? It is the core belief of the various New Thought religions such as the Centers for Spiritual Living (CSL) . The truth of these words live in my full body not just my head. Back when I was still an atheist I spent many Sundays in CSL church standing in witness to the music and crying as I awoke to this deeper truth.</description>

      <title>Eight is a magic number (tangent)</title>

      <description>Why is eight a magic number?
Valence shells Eight is a magic number in chemistry. When atoms combine into molecules they want to have exactly eight electrons in their outermost valence shell. Chemistry is based on this. It defines what atoms can join with what other atoms. So for example carbon atoms have 4 electrons in their outer valence shell and if you put two of them together that form a total of eight.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m curious to know if there is interest in this. It is kind of an amusing thing to think about. How could engineers have anything to contribute to the conversation of waking up to a bigger consciousness? And yet I think we do.
Post a message if you might be interested in me writing this up. Right now I am focused on the main path and this is definitely not that.</description>

      <description>Mercury Poisoning In December 2013, I had just gotten laid off and suddenly I was sick all of the time. I would be OK for a couple of days or even a week but then another cold or flu would hit and I would go back to being sick. On top of that I would get bouts of vertigo and have to reach out to something to keep from falling over.</description>

      <description>Snippets 2
Low carb When my son was in college I would visit once a month and take him and his girl friend out to lunch. We all loved Thai food so we often chose that. One day after lunch we came back to their dorm and I just had to crash on their couch. My son was concerned and started saying to his girlfriend, “This is not right. Something is really wrong here”.</description>

      <description>collection of snippets Missing Loving Presence principle Love is scary, so we hold back. From the very first weekend of my Hakomi trainings we were taught to create a loving bubble with our client. If we could not find a way to love them it was suggested they should maybe not even be our client. So clearly Hakomi is grounded first and foremost in Love but it was not yet one of the principles.</description>
