# Welcome!

Thank you so much visiting this web site!

It was hard for me to ask you to review something so unfinished. I am deeply grateful that you did! Your support and feedback is precious to me -- it will help me create something of value. I won't get there without you. Seriously.

My goal is to save the world. I hope to convince you to join me. And the very first step is to come up with a plan. A plan that can work. Many people are already hard at work healing this broken world, but each group is working mostly on their own. On our own we can only get so far. We need to join together as one. So even as we do our separate work we also need to coordinate on an even bigger dream -- saving all the world together.

This site is a home for this bigger plan. It is an open source website which means it is kind of like a managed wiki. Open source is centered around welcoming other people's contributions. Please consider joining me in this work. But even if you don't have time for that, please leave feedback. I need to hear the truth about both what works and what doesn't.

It is a pretty wild ambition to save the world. To even have a chance it will require many, many different voices speaking from a place of deep Truth. We all have our own paths to Truth, let me first start with mine.

# Save the World

There is so much suffering and pain in the world. When I let my heart open wide into the vastness of all that is, I go to an aching sadness. So. much. pain! Can you feel it also? At least a little? The sensitives among us certainly do. Here take this pill so you can function, as if shock and horror were not the most appropriate reaction to the world. As if everything is fine, just keep on going don't pay attention to that homeless person huddled miserably in the corner. And our history! Generation after generation passing its trauma on to the next. So many people growing up in hurt and lack. It hurts so much! The pain can feel like an immense, implacable ocean wave sweeping us away from the security of shore. Better, safer to hide away.

Then to find out that we are killing off most of the species on this planet, setting up a future catastrophe that could cause billions to die, and most people don't seem to really care. Don't seem to realize it for the existential threat that it is. It is easy to give in to hopelessness. What can any one person really do in the face of the relentless forces shaping the world? People are going to suffer in needless agony, and yes it is probably going to get much worse. We can do our best, but it probably won't be enough. It is hopeless.

And yet.

Stop and breath, and know.

There is hope. Always.

Even in the depths of horrific trauma there can be moments when all that pain cracks something open and lets Grace shine through. When despite it all we recognize the beauty and glory of simply being alive in this imperfect world and are profoundly grateful. Mixed with the filth there is also beauty, glory, and awe. All wrapped up together. There is no deeper joy without the deeper suffering.

And again I say there is hope. Please try to let that in, if only a little. It is what I want very most for this world to know.

Know that you are not alone. Brilliant people the world over have been working on this problem. And they have come up with all sorts of useful ideas and practices.  I wish more people knew about them. With these advances we will change the world:

* Better Theory.
* Better Therapy.
* Practical spirituality.

Together these advances are a path to teaching people how to open their hearts to a richer, deeper more fulfilling life. This could actually work. Work well enough so that we can maybe start to dream a bigger dream than we have so far. Start to dream of what is possible if only enough of us could get out of our pain and step into the joy of service. And from there maybe we can step into a whole world of joy. Why not?

I can't guarantee that we will get there. The possibility of failure is always very real, but I would not be creating this website if I did not truly, truly believe it is possible. The very first step is to hope. Are you willing to take that risk with me?

To care? I think I do know what I'm asking of you. Please join me anyways.
