[Hakomi](https://hakomiinstitute.com/) is a gentle but surprisingly powerful talk therapy that takes people way, way deep. It definitely is one of the paths to saving the world. But here I am going to focus mainly on the principles. These principles are a foundation we can build on. They can be our North star to help guide us when we get lost. If a Hakomi session didn't go as well as we would like, we were taught to look to the principles to see what was missing. In the same way we can use the principles to help us find what is not working in our lives.

[Hakomi](https://hakomiinstitute.com/) started with five founding principles. Loving Presence was added [here](https://hakomiinstitute.com/about/hakomi-mindful-somatic-psychotherapy/the-hakomi-principles). Truth and Change were added [here](https://www.hakomica.org/about-hakomi/method-process). This brings us to eight principles which seems like the [right number]({{< relref "/posts/eight.md" >}}) to me.

Just like I cycled through the Spiral Dynamic stages several times, I am going to do the same here with the Hakomi Principles. This first time through focuses on how can we use them for Healing Up. How can they guide our own healing?

The very, very first thing we need for healing is a safe place to do our work. And how do we create that? A deep commitment to non-violence. Hakomi starts here.
