Hakomi teaches that we all have core beliefs that are driving us without us consciously realizing it. You first need to build a loving bubble with your client, and let them really get how safe they are with you. Let them see that you will respect and honor all parts of them. Then you encourage them to go deeper. When they are feeling safe enough we take them to a non ordinary state of consciousness where they can get to the core of themselves.  Where they can find their truth. Quite often what they find is that they made some important choices as a child that helped them survive. So we honor the genius of the child for finding something that worked, but then help them see how that solution also has come with a price. A price that now maybe is not worth it. We then have the client notice that they as adults have many more resources now and can now find other solutions. But first maybe they just need to spend some time soothing that hurt child within and reassuring that child they are safe now.

HAI workshops revolve around group shares. People stand up in front of the group (usually stark naked) and are lovingly encouraged to share from the most vulnerable, authentic place they can find within themselves. Quite often people are inspired to stand up after having a breakthough during one of the exercises. There is something incredibly beautiful about sharing your deepest, naked Truth in front of a circle of sacred witnesses. A circle that holds all of you in love. This group support helped me to get to my deeper places. Helped me get clearer about what was really going on for me. Something about it would help clarify for me what it was that I needed to know. After speaking I quite often would sit down and run through what I just said because it was finally that clear message I needed to hear.  

Getting to the truth of the matter can be hard and scary. We tend to resist. And there are good reasons we conspire within ourselves to not know the full truth. Unless we can be compassionate and non-violent with all that we discover it actually might be a good idea to not let ourselves consciously know. But that conspiracy blocks the healing that needs to happen. What to do? In my Medicine Guide training we were taught to work with two medicines, MDMA and mushrooms. MDMA works on the relationship plane, the world of emotions and how we connect to others. It also helps us process our traumatic memories -- it is very promising for PTSD example. We first start clients with MDMA journey work. We need to establish a safe ground for them and establish a strong, loving bond with them to build up their trust. We also need to discover and work through whatever traumatic memories they need to process. The ones that have been too hard to deal with now. MDMA calms the ever vigilent amygdyla enough to allow these memories through, it also turns up oxytocin, the love hormone, to open their hearts wide enough to be fully compassionate with themselves. Trauma memories are different than normal memories in that they get "stuck". People relive their war incident or car accident as if it had happened just a moment ago. Under MDMA they get the opportunity to work through these memories with their therapist and convert them to more normal ones. Trauma never goes away, but you can shift and transform it to a healthier place. And even if you don't have full on trauma, almost all of us have places of such deep shame or anguish that we can't stand to go there.

So all of these schools are working to get people to their deeper Truth. Get them past whatever is blocking them from getting there. Without ever explicitly mentioning it they also are teaching people to get into the habit of always checking inside for their truth. To get in the habit of paying attentiong to what is going on to themselves. Encouraging them to take pauses to check in with themselves. What is going on right now? There is a name for this practice -- it is call mindfulness. Let's talk about that next.
