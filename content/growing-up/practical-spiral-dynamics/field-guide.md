How do we know what color level someone or group is at? To figure this out there are some questions we need to answer:

* Are they more individual focused (tick) or group focused (tock)?
* What do they know to be True?
* What are they willing to die for?

Let's go through the color levels again, but this time asking those questions.

## Beige (FirstAwakening)

At Beige focus starts on the individual family (tick). You know to be true what is right in front of you. You are willing to die for your family. There are a surprisingly large number of people buying missile silos to convert them into survival shelters. That is very Beige level thinking. By the way, I don't think they are necessarily wrong. If I had a lot of excess money, I would seriously consider doing something like that too. Family is where we start.

The whole point of backpacking is to get to this level. That is why people do it for extended periods of time. It takes a while to get back into this easy communion with nature. After you have gone a few days on the trail, the city mentality starts to finally fade away and we can finally just let ourselves be one with the natural world. It is a very beautiful mental place to get to. So if you find a backpacker on a long hike they are in that moment probably at Beige. The energy field of these people feels very clean and whole.

## Purple (KinSpirits)

At purple focus swings over to tribe and community (tock). You know to be true what the tribe knows to be true. You revere the local spirits of the land. You are willing to die to protect your tribe. Many indigenous people live their lives at this level. Many more people wish they could.

We all have a longing to be part of a tribe whether we are consciously aware of it or not. Groups like a church, or a yoga community can provide this. If the bond is strong enough this community can be said to be at the Purple level. This can sometimes be disastrous (think of religious cults gone bad), but sometimes it can be amazing (think of [Valerie Kaur's Sikh community](https://valariekaur.com/revolutionary-love-project/) )

## Red (PowerGods)

At Red focus spirals up and back to the individual (tick). You are still part of a tribe, but your people are the chosen people. You know that your tribe's truth is the only truth. And your destiny is to rule the world. You are willing to die for the honor of your king.

Olympic athletes are a good example of this stage. They are competing to be the world's best. Why would you wake up so early every morning and work so hard day after day, year after year? We all have that in us if we choose to find it.

Many of the people opposed to Covid vaccines are Red. Why? First they don't believe in the science, because that level comes later (Orange). Second because they are mostly focused just on themselves and don't really understand the need to sacrifice for the greater good.

I struggle with how much judgment I have about people who refuse the Covid vaccine. But it is important to really get that these people really and truly do not have scientific thinking online. It just is not a source of Truth for them. We can patiently tell them the science facts over and over, but that will not sway them. And it is not because they are dumb. Not at all. Scientific thinking is a later stage of development (Orange) and they don't have that expanded world view yet. Also I struggle with the selfishness of not wanting to protect others by getting vaccinated. This is another example of where people's hearts are smaller than I want them. I realize (in my wiser moments) that I have to first accept that is where they are then find a way to help them expand their hearts. In my experience yelling at people does not help them open their hearts. Have you had a different experience?


## Blue (TrueBlue)

At Blue focus spirals up and back to the group (tock). You are part of something so much bigger than yourself. Bigger even than just your tribe. You are willing to die for this greater Truth.

Mormons society is a good example of Blue. They have a beautiful focus on family and community. In my experience Mormon families do a surprisingly good job of raising their children to be decent, caring humans. Mitt Romney, a devout Mormon was the only republican senator to vote for Trump's first impeachemnt. It was an astonishingly brave thing to do. He explained why in his speech to congress:

> I am aware that there are people in my party and in my state who will strenuously disapprove of my decision, and in some quarters, I will be vehemently denounced. I am sure to hear abuse from the President and his supporters. Does anyone seriously believe I would consent to these consequences other than from an inescapable conviction that my oath before God demanded it of me?

That is such a beautiful example of Blue. He knows with all his heart that there is something more important than just himself. This is something he is willing to sacrifice all for because he has no choice.

Mormon society also is a good example of the problems of Blue. Like most Blue religions they firmly believe very non-scientific stories because they are not yet at the science (Orange) stage. The Mormon church also has a horrible history of sexism and racism because the Green stage is not yet online. Those problems are very real, but please recognize that there are benefits here too. People like Mitt Romney will not normally vote the way we want, but they can be our allies when the stakes are highest.

Another example of Blue is Alcohol Anonymous's [Twelve Steps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-step_program). The alchoholic recognizes that they are helpless before their addiction and need to surrender to a higher power. Recognize that there is a vast love and strength that is waiting for them if they can just let go enough to let it in. Notice that this is not a comfortable path -- quite the opposite, but the strength to bear it comes from something greater than themselves.
