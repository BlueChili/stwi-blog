How do we know what color level someone or group is at? To figure this out there are some questions we need to answer:

* Are they more individual focused (tick) or group focused (tock)?
* What do they know to be True?
* What are they willing to die for?

Let's go through the color levels again, but this time asking those questions.

## Beige (FirstAwakening)

Focus is on the individual family (tick). You know to be true what is right in front of you. You are willing to die for your family. There are a surprisingly large number of people buying missile silos to convert them into survival shelters. That is very Beige level thinking. By the way, I don't think they are necessarily wrong. If I had a lot of excess money, I would seriously consider doing something like that too. Family is where we start.

The whole point of backpacking is to get to this level. That is why people do it for extended periods of time. It takes a while to get back into this easy communion with nature. After you have gone a few days on the trail, the city mentality starts to finally fade away and we can finally just let ourselves be one with the natural world. It is a very beautiful mental place to get to. So if you find a backpacker on a long hike they are in that moment probably at Beige. The energy field of these people feel very clean and whole.

## Purple (KinSpirits)

Focus is on tribe and community (tock). You know to be true what the tribe knows to be true. You revere the local spirits of the land. You are willing to die to protect your tribe. Many indigenous people live their lives at this level. Many more people wish they could.

We all have a longing to be part of a tribe whether we are consciously aware of it or not. Groups like a church, or a yoga community can provide this. If the bond is strong enough this community can be said to be at the Purple level. This can sometimes be disastrous (think of religious cults gone bad), but sometimes it can be amazing (think of [Valerie Kaur's Sikh community](https://valariekaur.com/revolutionary-love-project/) )

## Red (PowerGods)

Focus is back again on the individual (tick). You are still part of a tribe, but your people are the chosen people. You know that your tribe's truth is the only truth. And your destiny is to rule the world. You are willing to die for the honor of your king.

Olympic athletes are a good example of this stage.
