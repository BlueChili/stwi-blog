# Welcome!

Thank you so much for visiting this web site! I am deeply grateful that you did! Your support and feedback is precious to me -- it will help me create something of value. I won't get there without you. Seriously.

I want a plan to save the world. A plan that might actually work. It is my deepest desire. When I tell people this they tend to recoil back -- whoah! way too big! Is this your reaction too? Maybe take a minute and get curious about that reaction. Why don't we have a plan to save the world? Doesn't the world need saving? Yes, of course it does. Why not spend some time thinking about this? Why isn't this conversation more common?

For thirty years I have watched global warming. Back in the 90's environmentalists knew a disaster was coming. The science was clear. And I did nothing. Each decade the climate scientists kept on coming back to report that it was even worse than we feared. And I did nothing. The reports got so bad I could not make myself read them. It hurt too much. If you read them carefully, you could hear the scientists screaming in anguish. And I still did nothing.

No longer.

My daughter is learning about how bad the situation is at school. Our children understand the reality of our situation much better than we do. She asked me if it is OK to have children. Ouch. I had to really think about it. I found myself bargaining with God. Maybe her children will be OK? But then she asked what about her children's children? And what about all future children? And the honest answer is I do not know.

What I do know is that I will not do nothing for another thirty years. The world needs even someone as ordinary as me. No matter how hard it gets I can not imagine anything more painful than to confess to my grandchildren thirty years from now that yet again I stood by and did nothing. With all my heart I want my daughter to have children if she wants if for not other reason than we need more healthy people to help clean up the mess we have left for them. But I am so worried.

Fortunately, while I did (mostly) nothing others have been hard at work. They have done so much and yet here we are. On our own we can only get so far. All the urgent projects that people are working on such as Black Lives Matter and Social Justice are vitally important. But we need to understand that we are all working on the same project. All this work shares the very same problem -- how do we get people into a bigger, more compassionate place? If we can get people there, the world changes in an instant. But that is very big work and it will require all of us. So even as we continue to do our separate work we also need to coordinate on an even bigger dream -- saving the world together.  

This site is a home for this bigger dream. For big problems like this we need the collective intelligence and wisdom of as many people as we can get. This site is set up to encourage and enable people to collaborate. Because we have work to do. We need to come up with something very new. To paraphrase Einstein, you can not solve problems with the same consciousness that created them. We need to step into a much bigger consciousness. We have learned so much, now it is time to put all that learning to use. We don't have much time.

For those thirty years I watched and wondered. What are the deeper causes of our problems? What is it that prevents people from opening their hearts wider and wider? What would it take on a practical level to save the world? I have been looking for people with workable answers. And they are out there! Now we need to bring these separate teachings together into an integrated whole. First we must cultivate these integrated teachings in ourselves because of course it has to start there, but then once we find our ground to stand on we can then look out to others and ask, "What is it that we want to create together?"

Apparently, the best way to get an answer on the internet is to answer a question wrong even if it is in answer to your own question. That seems to provoke people to respond. It is quite amusing, but it seems to work. So in that spirit I am going to provide my own answer here. If you have a better solution -- great! you have no idea how eager I am to hear it.

What do we need to make the world of our dreams?

### A Better Story

We need a better story. We forget how much our stories define us. Our stories tells us where we came from and what it is we are to do in this world. Right now our collective story holds us as very small. It tells us there is nothing we can do. But it doesn't have to be like that. We can choose to tell ourselves a very different story. A story that gives us courage. A story that lets us shake off this trance of helplessness and take on the task of saving the world with a heart full of passion. The right story will provide us hope. Hope that something huge might just want to awaken soon.

### Wider Healing

When I am hurting, my personal world collapses down. All I can manage is just to make it through the day. I can't take on anything beyond that. And collectively the world is hurting. Most people are in too much pain to do the bigger work. But it doesn't have to be like that. There have been some exciting breakthroughs in therapy that actually work. We need to spread this healing to everyone that needs it. When people emerge out of pain, incredible things happen.

### A Bigger Dream

We need to dream a bigger dream. Our way of living does not work. This calls for change. Radical change. We all know what needs to be done; we just are struggling to believe it possible. But imagine us coming together as a loving, supportive tribe that works together. That will be the core of it. There will be something that feels electric and right when it happens. People will flock to it because it is so much fun.

Together, we will start telling ourselves a different story. That this could actually work. Work well enough that maybe we can start to dream a bigger dream than we have so far. Start to dream of what is possible if only enough of us could get out of our pain and step into the joy of service. And from there maybe we can step into a whole world of joy. Why not?

I can't guarantee that we will get there. The possibility of failure is always very real, but I would not be creating this website if I did not truly, truly believe it is possible. The very first step is to hope. Are you willing to take that risk with me?

To care? I think I do know what I'm asking of you. Please join me anyways.
