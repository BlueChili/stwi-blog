This is the stage of empire. This is the stage of Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan, and Cortez. Rome was a very Red empire. The story became that it was natural and right that the strong govern the weak. Alexander is remembered as a "great" man, but by today's standards he would be considered a murdering lunatic. The Roman empire by today's standards was a hopelessly evil slave empire. Genghis Khan by all accounts was a self-actualized guy who achieved his biggest dreams. Too bad about all those millions his troops killed. But here is the most important point. Genghis and his tribe did not consider themselves evil. They considered themselves the good guys. And you have to kind of marvel at their martial excellence.

There is of course a real darkness here. Brutal wars of conquest swept across the world. Wealth and power went to the very top and if you were in the vast bottom your average life span went way down.  Much of the suffering of the world still comes from this stage of thinking. And there is no turning back. Much as we might like to go back to Purple we have no choice. We have way too many people on this planet now to sustain a traditional Purple lifestyle. It is like when Cortes landed on the shores of Aztec Mexico, he destroyed his ships. Can you imagine what it must have felt like for the men with him to watch that? It made very clear that the only way was to move forward or die. It is the same for us. If we want to get home to the world we long for we have to first accept our reality. Accept this is who we are. Accept the horror and suffering. Accept that we are all complicit.

And yet. We would become as Gods! Without this stage we would not have gone from looking up in wonder at the moon, to landing on it and looking back at the pale blue marble of earth. Think of what we are most proud of as a species -- writing, conquering disease, teasing out the secrets of the big bang, learning to fly, exquisite, beautiful works of music, art, and architecture. All of these had to start with the crazy determination to go to that next stage. We were not content to simply stay just as we were. This is the stage of personal excellence. The dedication and courage of an Olympic athlete starts here. The desire to radically change the world is very Red. The warriors who fight to keep us safe have a hot Red core to them. We need this stage just as much as any of the stages, even despite all the trauma it brings. This stage can provide the courage to keep on fighting even when all seems lost and keeping on would be pointless. To keep on fighting even if at times it feels like just a [futile and stupid gesture](https://youtu.be/q7vtWB4owdE)

But in different regions of the world at different times people woke up and said "Enough! We need something bigger than this! Life must be more than just the strong oppressing the weak". And something did arise. Something very beautiful.
