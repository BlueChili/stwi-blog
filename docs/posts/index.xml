      <description>Everything is God (the Universe) and God (the Universe) is love&amp;quot;
Does this ring true to you? It is the core belief of the various New Thought religions such as the Centers for Spiritual Living (CSL) . The truth of these words live in my full body not just my head. Back when I was still an atheist I spent many Sundays in CSL church standing and crying as I awoke to this deeper truth.</description>

      <description>Why is eight a magic number?
Valence shells Eight is a magic number in chemistry. Molecules want to have exactly eight electrons in their outermost valence shell. Chemistry is based on this. It defines what atoms can join with what other atoms. So for example carbon atoms have 4 electrons in their outer valence shell. So a simple combination is to put two carbon atoms together to form a total of eight.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m curious to know if there is interest in this. It is kind of an amusing thing to think about. How could engineers have anything to contribute to the conversation of waking up to a bigger consciousness? And yet I think we do.
Post a message if you might be interested in me writing this up. Right now I am focused on the main path and this is definitely not that.</description>

      <description>collection of snippets Hakomi Body-Centered Psychotherapy
Old paradigm New paradigm fundamental separateness unbroken wholeness
fundamental connectedness absolute certitude
only matter is real (materialism) uncertainty, relativity
consciosness is real (dualistm, monism) the mind/body split mind/body integration biology is destingy we create our own destiny Goal My goal is to first save the world, because it needs saving. If we don&amp;rsquo;t stop carbon dioxide emissions soon, billions will die. But we have to go way beyond just that because in some ways it already is too late.</description>
