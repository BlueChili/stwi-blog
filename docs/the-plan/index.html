<main><h1>The Plan</h1><p>Before diving into the specifics of the plan, let&rsquo;s take a moment and review the overall structure of the plan. What are the parts and how do they fit together.</p>
<h3 id="the-goal">The Goal</h3>
<p>What do we truly want for this world? What would light us up all the way? I suggested earlier that we don&rsquo;t have to overthink this. Let the children guide us. And in particular, let our inner child guide us. We already know what we dream for the world, we just have to dare to believe it is possible. On some beautiful day the world is going to wake up in love and joy. But we can&rsquo;t just jump straight there from where we are now. This is where the work is.</p>
<h3 id="integral-theory">Integral Theory</h3>
<p>Ken Wilber is a brilliant philosopher who had the insight that it is more than past time to integrate all the different worlds of human experience into one integrated theory. Western philosopy, Eastern philosophy, Empiricism, Spirituality, Budhism, and everything else all brought together as one. This theory is called Integral Theory. I find that it is a great theoretical foundation to build upon. It explains a lot of things well.</p>
<p>This is his beautifully succint summary of the work we all need to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Growing Up</li>
<li>Cleaning Up</li>
<li>Waking Up</li>
<li>Showing Up</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="growing-up">Growing Up</h3>
<p>We all move through developmental stages as individuals. Societies do as well. Before we can change the world we have to really understand and model how differently people look at the world. This is the map I was talking about earlier. We need to get deeper than just assuming that eveyone thinks about things pretty much like we do. They don&rsquo;t. Not even close in fact. And yet some how, some way we need to convince people to open their hearts to a wider and wider sphere. How do we do that? First we need to meet them right where they are and talk to them in a language that works for them. There is a theory called Spiral Dynamics that I think is perfect for this. It describes the major stages that humanity has already gone through and offers some predictions on what wants to happen next. Each stage described in Spiral Dynamics builds on the next. The higher the stage, the higher the understanding of the world. Our hope is to shift everyone into these higher stages.</p>
<h3 id="cleaning-up">Cleaning Up</h3>
<p>We start with our initial wounds as children and then over time we accumulate more and more junk inside of ours ourselves that hides us from our true nature. In Spirited Away there is a [wonderful scene] (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/FansOfStudioGhibli/videos/spirited-away-bathhouse-clip/493650414055324/">https://www.facebook.com/FansOfStudioGhibli/videos/spirited-away-bathhouse-clip/493650414055324/</a>) where an incredibly repugnant, stinky spirit comes to the bathhouse for help. At first it looks hopeless, why waste good medicinal water on something so dirty as that. But the heroine, Sen, bravely persists in trying to help. Then it becomes clear that there is something stuck to the spirit that doesn&rsquo;t belong. The entire bathhouse community joins together to help pull this thing out. And as they do more and more stuff keeps coming out. A lifetime accumulation of junk comes pouring out. Until there is just one more tug and a &ldquo;pop&rdquo; and all we are left with is the spirit&rsquo;s true, smiling nature. We all have this work of pulling out all the wounded junk of a life time to get back to our true, shining nature.</p>
<h3 id="waking-up">Waking Up</h3>
<p>The bathhouse clip above doesn&rsquo;t show it, but what happens next after all the junk is removed is that the smiling true spirit becomes a water dragon that roars up out of the bathhouse and blasts away into the sky. We are all spiritual beings. After we have done our cleaning up this becomes achingly obvious, and then just like the dragon we go roaring out into the sky. This is what we are meant to do, but unfortunately many of us have too much junk still attached to us (cleaning up). Also most of the organizations that purport to support spirituality are still stuck in earlier developmental stages (growing up). Most religions are not advanced enough to meet this moment.</p>
<p>The end goal is to get people to open their hearts wider and wider. Wide enough to encompass all that needs to be done. A reawakened spirituality can get us there. When we fully embrace our spirituality we know the other as us. There is no artificial separation between you and me. You are all my brothers and sisters and even closer. This is the teaching of both Buddha and Christ. It is, I believe, a fundamental ground of spirituality. But again we can&rsquo;t just jump right here. We need to first do the work of growing up and cleaning up.</p>
<h3 id="showing-up">Showing Up</h3>
<p>The dragon roaring into the air is the first step of showing up. At first we fly alone. But then we fly and dance in the sky with others. It starts with us discovering our internal strength and beauty. And then we fall down in awe and wonder as we recognize the awesome beauty and majesty of others. And as we truly start to finally fully open up to the world, we start to feel the pain of the world. This world is suffering. When you open yourself fully to all that is, it hurts! It hurts really bad. Yes, there is so much joy there too, but oh the pain! What to do? The strong temptation is to run away. Or to give in to despair. This is much too big for one person to deal with. And yet. I think Buddha taught best about this. First it is important to recognize the pain, then to step fully into the pain. And finally we can awaken to something bigger.</p>
<h4 id="recognize-the-pain">Recognize the Pain</h4>
<p>If you are at the point of feeling the world&rsquo;s pain, congratulations. Most of us hide from it. It means that you have allowed yourself to open up in a bigger, wider way than most. This is where we have to start. Notice how upsetting all of this. For me, entering the Grandfather stage of life, it is hardest to accept how I and my generation have so profoundly failed to provide a healthy, nurturing place for my grandchildren and their children to grow up in. This is so not OK with me. And again, I stop and breathe and let myself really recognize how much pain there is. It starts here.</p>
<h4 id="step-fully-into-the-pain">Step fully into the pain</h4>
<p>I start to breathe into the pain. Letting it be. I stop fighting it and I start to embrace it. This is important. I need to pay attention to this. Once I get past the shock of it, I notice that pain always brings a gift with it &ndash; the energy to change. We make our biggest shifts when we are in great pain. It takes something like that to make us leap to something new. If the right kind of support is there we can learn that this pain is a path of transformation. No guarantees on this one sadly, but there is a beauty and joy that can shine out through the cracks of the deepest suffering. And that light illuminates the path that we ultimately need to follow. And the pain provides the energy and courage for us to start on that path.</p>
<p>And then I notice something different this time. As I sit with this immense, vast pain I realize that I am at least as big as this pain because I also am immense and vast. How can I not be? I am one with all. Time to own that. I no longer need to hide away &ndash; I am big enough to contain all of this.</p>
<h4 id="awaken-to-something-bigger">Awaken to something bigger</h4>
<p>I then awaken to the fact that I am part of a vast shared consciousness that is trying to figure out what wants to happen next. Part of this consciousness wants to go back to sleep and part wants to wake up. I am on the side of us all waking up. It is time. And as unworthy and yes, maybe even broken as I feel myself to be, I offer myself up in service to waking the world up. Not even sure if that is ultimately what wants to happen, but nevertheless knowing this is what I am called to do. I look inwards and see my suffering and then I look outwards to see the suffering of the world . I look inwards to see my joy and then I look outwards to see the joy of living in this world. Breathing into myself and then out into the world and then breathing in again. Letting myself know that I am as big as all of this. This is my deeper work. This is my purpose.</p>
<p>And then I circle back to where I started &ndash; that childlike sense of awe and wonder. That knowing that the world can be very, very beautiful. But it takes a magic wish to start it all.</p>
<p>Ready to start this magic journey with me?</p>
