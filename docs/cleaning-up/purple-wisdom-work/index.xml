      <description>There sometimes is tremendous temptation to help people along by getting a little tough with them for their own good. Maybe hold them accountable for what they said they would do but didn&amp;rsquo;t. Maybe point them in the direction they need to go and push them a little. Some personal growth workshops take this approach and for a brief time people will have remarkable results. But the results don&amp;rsquo;t last. This is not the path to healing.</description>

      <title>Truth</title>

      <description>In Beige we look inside ourselves for our truth. In Purple we find our truth with others. HAI workshops revolve around group shares. People stand up in front of the group (usually stark naked) and are lovingly encouraged to share from the most vulnerable, authentic place they can find within themselves. Quite often people are inspired to stand up after having a breakthrough during one of the exercises. Or maybe they are moved to share their most painful secret.</description>

      <title>Mindfulness</title>

      <description>There is a lot of truly great writing about mindfulness. For example, Mark Manson has an excellent article [here]. He writes in his vivid way of all the amazing benefits both health-wise and mental. But in that article he lightly touches upon something that is often overlooked. We tend to think of meditation as the only way to cultivate mindfulness. It is not. Meditation is not the answer to all our problems.</description>

      <description>I talked about taking care our bodies. Let’s now go deeper and talk about what happens when we have trauma. When we suffer a traumatic event we store that trauma somewhere in our body. When Bessel van der Kolk, author of The Body Keeps the Score, first started out as a psychiatrist his profession didn&amp;rsquo;t have much to offer traumatized people. They didn&amp;rsquo;t even really recognize PTSD as a thing. That has changed.</description>

      <description>I’m afraid that by just reading this site you will get the impression that this personal growth stuff is all very serious, hard work that involves a lot of suffering. It can be that way, but it doesn’t have to be. If you find the right healing group this work actually becomes tremendous fun. Yes it is still very challenging, but it just feels right. You are not alone. Others are doing similar work as you and you are supporting each other every step of the way.</description>

      <description>I recently watch a movie called Manchester by the Sea. The movie has amazing acting and is quite well done. But I don’t recommend it. At all. I think the movie has the best possible intentions, but never the less it promotes a very dangerous story. It portrays deeply, deeply traumatized people stumbling around causing harm to themselves and others without any recognition that it doesn’t have to be like that.</description>

      <description>There is a certain connection magic that always comes up for a group that goes through something intense together. People connect and become one. It is part of being human. We are a deeply social animal and we are meant to form groups both large and small. We even have mirror neurons dedicated to this task.
If someone is grieving I grieve too. If someone is in pain I hurt also.</description>

      <description>In the Beige homework section I mainly suggested (or listening) to books. In Purple my suggestion is to now start doing this work with others. There is tremendous healing power in groups.
Trauma Test This is the big one. You almost certainly know on some level if you have had major trauma. What was your childhood like? Were you beaten or abused or maybe simply neglected? Those all can cause deep trauma.</description>
