Let's start. May I have your permission to dream with me? Dream way, way, way bigger than you maybe normally do? OK? Here is my question: What do you really want. I mean really. Yes, yes you can have a billion dollars -- boom -- now keep on going deeper. This is a dream after all so you can have anything. What do you want beyond just the personal stuff? Maybe happiness for others? How about living in a world of joy for all? Wait, you can imagine a billion dollars but not that? Stay with me here. Let's try again. Stop and breathe. Settle down into your body. Notice where you are and everything you are feeling in this moment right now. And then ask yourself the question again, but this time from your heart. What is the biggest dream you can dream? How big can you open your heart? Notice if resistance comes up. That is very normal. Try to really get in touch with what that resistance is about. Know that it is very valuable to get in touch with this -- it is going to guide us on the work that needs to happen. Just about all of us are working on expanding our hearts. I don't think we ever are done with this work. And we all can use teachers.

My first great teacher was my son. It happened in an unexpected way. After graduating from college I flew to Japan to teach English. My third week in Tokyo the Japanese woman I was became pregnant with my child. She was fifteen years older than me, and we had been having a fling. No love between us at really. She told me to go, she could handle this. But I had a waking vision -- I never have waking visions -- of a 18 year old stranger knocking on my door saying, "Dad?". I had no idea of "what" needed to happen, but I was so very, very clear "not that". And that turned out to be enough. I stayed and for the next couple of years I poured as much love into my time with son as I could. Never taking for granted that this was going to last. And I was astonished to learn that the more love I poured in the more I had to give. The love kept on getting bigger and bigger. Luckily I persuaded his mom four years later on to move to the U.S. and I got to stay with him. That relationship with his mom was fraught and incredibly painful, but that pain seems so small compared to the incredible gift of my son. And I learned so much. It was my first step into that bigger place of love that I am talking about.

When I try to really open up to this huge dream of a world of joy for all, there is something inside me that resists. As if I am not worthy of something as grand as that. But for my children? I love my children with all my heart and want the world for them.  And in fact I want the world for all children. Even if you don't have children, hopefully you can feel that too. So for them? yes, with all my heart I can ask for a better world. I want an amazing, vibrant world for them. It is hard to ask for this for myself, but so simple to ask on their behalf. So maybe it really is that simple. Just let our love for our children guide us. What kind of world works best for raising children? Focus on that. What horrible secrets are we keeping from our children? Get rid of that.  

How do we create a vision of this bright beautiful new world? We don't have to -- it has already been done. It's called Mr. Roger's Neighborhood. Both a documentary and a movie about Mr. Roger's neighborhood came out recently. I strongly recommend watching both. They complement each other:

  * [A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Beautiful_Day_in_the_Neighborhood)
  * [Won't You Be My Neighbor?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Won%27t_You_Be_My_Neighbor%3F_(film))

This is the essay that inspired the movie, I highly recommend it too. It is very powerful:

  * [Can you say hero?](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a27134/can-you-say-hero-esq1198/)

Fred Roger told every child they are beautiful and perfect just the way they are. Great start! I want the whole world to be like that. I want a world where every child grows up without trauma, safe and secure in the knowledge that they are deeply loved and cherished. I want every child to have multiple adults that love them unconditionally and who they can turn to when they are confused or hurting. Every child encouraged to flourish and taught to recognize the majesty and beauty of this world. And just like in his show I want them to know that people can work through their differences in healthy, loving, productive ways. How can we settle for anything less than a world that is healthy for our children? I want a world that works in all ways for children. It is not enough to just stabilize our climate -- that is the bare minimum. I want a world where our children thrive. To grow up in a culture of kindness and respect, not in a climate of fear and hurt.

Does this sound too naive and simple? Consider the alternative. Particularly in the U.S. Think of the shooting of little children at Sandy Hook. If you are willing and able, please let yourself feel at least a little of the horror of all those dead little bodies with bullet holes bleeding on the ground. And it is OK if that is too much to let in even a little -- that is exactly my point.  We have had countless mass shootings of children. And nothing has changed. So many children dead, so many parents grieving. And somehow we are OK with this. Children mercilessly separated from their parents at the border, and then somehow the government "lost" the parents. Those orphaned children will be scarred for life. And we are somehow OK with that too. Black moms having to explain to their sons how dangerous a world it is for them. As if those boys are not all of our sons. And with global climate change there is a very realistic possibility that billions of future children may die. Seriously. What species cares so little for its offspring? This is so not OK. Something has to change.

(Greta Thunberg)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Thunberg] is talking directly to me here. To my failures. To all the adults who have so badly failed her. It is not her job to save the world, but ours. How dare we push this on to future generations. How dare we not own up to our own very great failures and commit to doing better. She is speaking from a place of sacred, righteous anger. Although she shouldn't have to be, she is showing up as my teacher.  Teaching me how to be more effective in the world. I was so scared of my own anger that I sat on it and hid it for thirty years. No longer. This kind of anger is sacred and holy. And it brings a precious gift too -- the fire and passion to meet our problems head on instead of running away.
