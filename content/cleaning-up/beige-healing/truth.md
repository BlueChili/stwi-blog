It turns out that I could have avoided those horrible acne cysts simply by giving up milk fat. My hometown happened to have one of the very few dermatologists in the country who understood that. If I had gone to him right away I would have been spared most of my trauma.  I was drinking close to a gallon of milk a day (growing teenage boy) not to mention all the pizza and ice cream I was eating. If I had given that up the cysts would have stopped just like that.

I was in victim mode. When we are in victim we give our power away to something else, and hold ourselves helpless. My parents “knew” that there was nothing doctors could do about acne so they didn’t suggest I go one. The opposite of victim is accountability. This mindset constantly is asking “How did I attract this? What was my part?” So instead of just staying in stuck in the trance of helplessness and victim I could have explore what I could do differently to stop the acne cysts. 

If we want to heal we have to find our deeper truths. Hakomi gently guides clients deeper and deeper into a non ordinary state of consciousness that helps them get all the way down to their core beliefs. These are the (mostly) unconscious beliefs people have about how the world works. What is and is not safe. These beliefs are usually created by a child desperately trying to survive against unfair odds. So we honor the genius of that child for finding something that worked, but then help them see how that solution also came with a price. A price that now maybe is not worth it. As adults they now have more resources and there are better solutions available. But first maybe they just need to spend some time soothing that hurt child and reassuring them that they are safe now.

Think of people you know in your life who are struggling. Almost always they are not letting themselves know something important. Maybe they are verging on alcoholism or other addictive behaviors. Maybe they are so consumed with fear that they don't see how they are only focused on themselves and oblivious to the harm they are causing to others. It is so obvious to us as observers, but they are not letting themselves know it. We can try to compassionately help them find their Truth but this is something ultimately they have to find within themself.  We can't do it for them.

Now turn to yourself. You can see it in others, but what about you? What truths are you hiding from yourself? There must be some. There always is. There is a very good reason we conspire with ourself to not know the full truth -- it would hurt too much. But as we practice non-violence we start to feel safer with more and more of our truth. And we start to get curious -- how deep and vast are we? We start to develop a habit of tracking ourselves. Catching those brief instants where we see the tail of Coyote whipping around that corner. Letting us know that, huh, there is something more going on here. Coyote is the trickster that shows up whenever we get too sure we fully know our Truth. We don't really but we think we do and Coyote just laughs and laughs at us. To find out more we need to get patient and simply watch ourselves. Yes, Coyote go ahead and laugh, you are right of course I must be missing something. I will get quiet and still to see what it is. I call this mindfulness. Let's turn to that next.
