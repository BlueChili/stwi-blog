Think of all the many, many school shooting. Think of the students shuddering in fear and horror next to their dead class mates. We (quite rightly) hold back from the horror of that, but it is the world we live in. How on earth have we gotten so acclimated to this? This is so not OK. It is a great moral failure on all our parts. And it makes me very, very angry. I name this anger sacred and holy. Anger brings the energy and determination to make change. Anger is a sword and sometimes we need this sword to cut through all the bullshit. No more! We to find our warrior in stand together in strength.

But many of us are scared of our warrior. Scared of the damage warriors can do. So we pull back from our power. And this fear is very justified. When you step fully into your power, your bullshit becomes that much powerful too. So once again we circle back to ourselves. Standing in power is never a safe thing, but we can make it safer by really getting to know all of ourselves. And to really know all of ourself it has to be safe. We need compassion for our desire to dominate and/or dominated. We need compassion for our jealousies and judgments. We need compassion for our selfishness and greed. We need compassion for our crazy, scary rage. We need compassion for that fear that holds us as too small.

Because what wants to happen is that we arise as warriors willing to fight for this world. That warrior is within all of us longing to be released. This world is worth fighting for. Some causes are worth dying for. This is one.

We need as many warriors as we can because there is a big fight ahead of us. Things can not stay as they are. They just can’t. Let’s go to change next.
