We can have our ecstatic moments, but what really matters is what we bring back to our daily life. Medicine guides most important work is to help people integrate their journey realizations. Help them realize that they get to really own this new amazing thing they have discovered.  When starting a Medicine journey, quite often we struggle to surrender to the medicine, but once we do we almost always eventually end up in a beautiful spot. Maybe we  wrap our arms around an angel and blast to another planet, or maybe we die and find ourself in a world of peaceful joy where our painful body no longer troubles us. It can be hard to come back from that. But that is our work — integrating all this new experience. The initial journey is great, but it is in the follow up sessions with the therapist where usually the important work is done. The client now knows what is possible — the work is to fully bring it into themself and live from that place.

Hakomi is less dramatic, but the principle is the same. The therapist helps a client find the internal change needed (usually a changed story about themselves), and then helps them really ground in the joy of that change. Helps them feel all the way in their body how good and right it feels. Then encourages them to really own this new way of being. Again just like with Medicine work the key thing here is to have the client integrate this change into themselves and make it a part of them self. Something that was held apart is now part of a whole.

Forest bathing has us come back to relationship with the more then human world. We suffer when we hold ourselves separate from that. It used to take me three days of backpacking before I finally let myself feel really as one with nature. I would finally, finally drop my city mind thoughts and simply be content to be just walking along the trail. No longer separate I was feeling unity. Forest bathing almost always involves an invitation to just sit for a while in nature. The invitation is to let yourself be part of this natural world. It is a tremendously healing practice.

Feeling unity with something beautiful like nature is one thing, but what about the ugly, hard things?
What about the parts of our selves that we hate or consider dangerous and bad? Yes, especially those parts need to be embraced. I never said this work is easy! But maybe the most important thing I have to say in this entire essay is that we need to find unity with all of ourselves. Truly all of ourselves. Unity consciousness is going to change the world. But first we need to find it in ourselves. We are vast beyond all knowing. Can we embrace all that we are? Even the monster within? Learn to love it? How on earth can we do that? We need to adopt the practice of loving presence. That is where we always come back to. That is both the reward and destination for all this hard work we are doing.
