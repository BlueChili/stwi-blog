We need to love and be loved. It all comes down to that. This is [not that complicated](https://open.spotify.com/album/08rSr5tinC3ZsQMPFgYuW4). Let's go back to Aaron Stark's story about how he almost became a school shooter. What saved him? Simply a friend's undemanding love. The friend wasn't trying to fix him, he just wanted to spend time with him. Even though he had lied to him and stolen from him, his friend was still there. Love freely given with no expectations. What a beautiful, simple but very powerful gift. What would the world look like if more people got the love they needed? Please sit with that thought for a moment. Maybe breathe into it. It really is the core of my plan -- my longing is for us to all get back to here. To that place where we feel loved and are willing to take the scary risk of loving others.

And it is scary, so we hold back. From the very first weekend of my Hakomi trainings we were taught to create a loving bubble with our client. If we could not find a way to love them it was suggested they should maybe not even be our client.  So clearly Hakomi is grounded first and foremost in Love but it was not yet one of the principles.  Which made no sense. I made a point of privately asking every teacher why Love was not one of the principles and every one of them kind of blinked in surprise and said -- it should be! They couldn't really explain why it wasn't, but I think I know. It turns out that I am not the only one who thought that if you caress someone's face and look deeply into their eyes that that means sex has to happen next. Therapists are taught to hold a certain separation from their client and to expect their clients to project all sorts of things onto them. Therapists fear that they will break down and maybe take advantage of their client's hunger for love and validation. It happens all too often.
