A woman I was exploring dating with asked me what my accomplishments were. I struggled to come up with an answer. I love computer programming and have done some good work on some fun projects, but I don’t really hold on to any part of my career as an “accomplishment”. The woman abruptly cut off contact after that — she needed someone who has accomplished something in life. That stung but it was fine, I already had recognized that she had way too much ego attachment for a relationship to work. But it was an interesting question so I kept on thinking about it, and eventually I came up with something.  I have worked hard my whole life to get to the truth of the matter. And that really does feel like an accomplishment. Now that I am in the “charting the course for others” phase of my life I look around and see that in this one thing I might be ahead of most others. There are a couple of reasons for that, but maybe the biggest is that getting to the truth requires that we really recognize how much we are constantly lying to ourselves. All. the. time. And how do we work with this? Mindfulness. 

There is a real discomfort to this. When we lie to ourselves we would much prefer that we don’t notice the lie. That is the whole point after all.  Let me give an example.  When I wrote about my mom asking me to get serious makeup work done before the wedding pictures, I realized that I never confronted her about that. I quickly told myself that I was protecting her feelings. But then I caught the tell-tale whiff of lying to myself yet again. Yes, protecting my mom was part of it, but even bigger than that I was protecting myself. So I was lying to myself in my favorite way — partial disclosure. And even the fact that I never even considered asking her was part of an internal conspiracy to stave of the pain. That whole thing was incredibly painful, why on earth would I want to wallow in it? I don’t need to wallow in my suffering, but I do want to step into all that I am. I don’t want to hide from myself parts that are inconvenient or hard to accept.

To get to where we need to go I’m asking you to step into the more difficult truths. Again, if this all gets too much, please, please take care of yourself. We usually lie to ourselves for a very good reason. And that is OK. Truly. And yet, as much as you safely can, please recognize that we all are holding back from any number of truths. This work takes patience and gentleness. The more we try to force it the harder we fight. The trick is to just stay curious and mindful. Huh. What was that right now? Notice how I quickly swept that thought away? Hmm. What is going on here? I sense there is something more here.

Do you see how this works? The very first thing is to not beat yourself up around the lying. I had very good reasons to lie to myself —  a part of me was trying to protect me from a lot of pain.
