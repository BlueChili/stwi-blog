# Welcome!

Thank you so much for visiting this web site! Your support and feedback is so vital -- it will help me create something of value. I won't get there without you. Truly.

I was talking about global warming with my teenage daughter and she asked me if it is OK to have children. Ouch. Truly ouch. What a question. I had to really think about it. Getting to the truth is really important here, but it is so hard. Maybe her children will be OK? But then she asked what about her children's children? And what about all future children? What kind of world are we passing on to them?

For thirty years I have done nothing. Back in the 90's environmentalists knew a disaster was coming. The science was clear. And I did nothing. Each decade the scientists kept on coming back to report that it was even worse than we feared. And I did nothing. The reports got so bad I could not make myself read them. It hurt too much. If you read them carefully, you can hear the scientists screaming in anguish. And I still did nothing.

No longer.

I will not do nothing for another thirty years. I have been waiting for someone else to take care of it. That hasn't worked The world needs someone even as ordinary as me. No matter how hard it gets I can not imagine anything more painful than confessing to my grandchildren thirty years from now that yet again I stood by and did nothing. With all my heart I want my daughter to have children if that is what she wants. Her children will help heal this world. But we have to give up this comforting story that it will work itself out on its own. That someone else is going to handle it.

And actually others have been hard at work. They have done so much and yet here we are. On our own we can only get so far. We need a movement that brings us together. Because together we are strong. Strong enough to heal this hurting world. We still need people fighting like hell for things like emissions reductions, Black Lives Matter, and Social Justice. That doesn't go away. But even as we do that vitally important work we also need to coordinate on an even bigger dream -- saving the world together.  

This site is a home for this bigger dream. For big problems like this we need the collective intelligence and wisdom of as many people as we can get. This site is set up to encourage and enable people to collaborate. Because we have work to do. We need to come up with something very new. To paraphrase Einstein, you can not solve problems with the same consciousness that created them. We need to step into a much bigger consciousness. We don't have much time.

We need a plan to save the world. A plan that might actually work. A plan that addresses all of the needless suffering of the world. Ecological collapse, racism, sexism, genocide -- all of it. Coming up with a shared plan is my deepest desire. When I tell people this they tend to recoil back -- whoah! way too big! Is that your reaction too? To be completely honest it is my reaction too at times. It seems so overwhelming -- who am I to even bring this up? But why are we so quick to assume it is impossible? Maybe because we tend to hold ourselves as small and helpless. I hope to convince you that we all are bigger and more powerful than we think we are. And even more importantly we can do this together. We don't have to stand alone. We can step out of this trance that holds us as separate. That trance is what is holding us back. It doesn't have to be like this. It really doesn't.

What are the deeper causes of our problems? What prevents us from opening our hearts wider and wider? What would it take on a practical level to save the world? I have been looking for answers. And they are out there! Many people have such important things to teach us. Now we need to bring these separate teachings together into an integrated whole. First we must awaken these teachings in ourselves because of course it has to start there. That is the ground we must stand on. But once we are standing in that place of strength we can then look out to others and ask, "What is it that we want to create together?"

Apparently, the best way to get an answer on the internet is to answer a question wrong even if it is in answer to your own question. That seems to provoke people to respond. It is quite amusing, but it seems to work. So in that spirit I am going to provide my own answer here. If you have a better solution -- great! you have no idea how eager I am to hear it.

What do we need to make [the more beautiful world our hearts know is possible](https://charleseisenstein.org/books/the-more-beautiful-world-our-hearts-know-is-possible/)

### A Better Story

We need a better story. We forget how much our stories define us. Our stories tells us where we came from and what it is we are to do in this world. Right now our collective story holds us as very small. It tells us there is nothing we can do. But it doesn't have to be like that. We can choose to tell ourselves a very different story. A story that gives us courage. A story that lets us shake off this trance of helplessness and take on the task of saving the world with a heart full of passion. The right story will provide us hope. Hope that something huge might just want to awaken soon.

### Wider Healing

When I am hurting, my personal world collapses down. All I can manage is just to make it through the day. I can't take on anything beyond that. And collectively the world is hurting. Most people are in too much pain to do the bigger work. But it doesn't have to be like that. It is not hopeless. Therapy can really help, and there have been some exciting, recent breakthroughs that make it even better. We need to spread this healing to everyone that needs it. When people emerge out of pain, incredible things happen.

### Unity consciousness

We feel separate and lonely. We feel helpless and small facing the problems of the world. But that is just a story we keep telling ourselves. In fact we are big, very big. But to get there we need to embrace all of ourselves. Not just the comfortable parts that get approval from others, but the darker hurting places as well. They need love too. Especially those parts. And when we embrace all of ourself it becomes possible to embrace all others. Even the ones that have hurt us. Even the ones that scare us and make us mad. The things we don't love in others is what we don't love in ourself. The more we can have deep compassion for ourselves darkness and all, the more we can have compassion for others darkness and all.

We think this work belongs to others not us. We await the next messiah, someone who is more qualified or capable than us. We forget that we are all one. It has always been possible to save the world, we just need to wake up from this trance and do it.

### A Bigger Dream

It is time to dream a bigger dream. Our way of living does not work. This calls for change. Radical change. We all know what needs to be done; we just are struggling to believe it possible. But imagine us coming together as a loving, supportive, wise tribe. That will be the core of it. It will feel electric and right when it happens. People will flock to it because it is so much fun.

Together, we will start telling ourselves a different story. That this could actually work. Work well enough that maybe we can start to dream a bigger dream than we have so ar. Start to dream of what is possible if only enough of us could get out of our pain and step into the joy of service. And from there maybe we can step into a whole world of joy. Why not?

I can't guarantee that we will get there. The possibility of failure is always very real, but I would not be creating this website if I did not truly, truly believe it is possible. The very first step is to hope. Are you willing to take that risk with me?

To care? I think I do know what I'm asking of you. Please join me anyways.
