      <description>Let’s go all the way back to the time of Jesus. Blue insists he was the son of God as if that isn’t true for all of us. No, he was just a dude. But oh my what an enormous impact he had on the world. Please don’t hold against him the many later crimes committed in his name. Let’s go back to the time when Christianity was just starting.</description>

      <description>How do we know something is True? This is such an important, fundamental question and yet I don’t see people thinking about it. I used to believe that only rationality could get me to Truth. Now I realize that while I will always honor and cherish my rationality, it is only one path to Truth. There are others.
In my mid thirties, I developed a very dangerous, painful tumor in my spinal column.</description>

      <description>Finding your connection with spirit, is a very personal internal thing. No one can do it for you. You first need to be open to the possibility of spirit even existing. If your heart and mind are firmly closed to it then it won’t happen. That is where I was at after my Angel’s kiss. Even though I now had overwhelming evidence of spirit, it was just too much. I packed it into a box and stacked it way, way back in the closet of my mind.</description>

      <description>I don’t know about more recent generations, but in my generation we absolutely did not talk about masturbation. It was shameful and wrong. The surgeon general, Dr Joycelyn Elders was promptly fired when she said that masturbation was healthy, normal, and should be taught in school. No one questioned Clinton getting rid of her — of course she had to be fired!
So let’s talk about masturbation.
First of all, what a beautiful even potentially sacred act of self love.</description>
