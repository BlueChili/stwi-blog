### GÃ¶del Escher Bach
By Douglas R. Hofstadter

If you feel like exploring your rational mind, this is definitely the book for you. This is the best book I've seen for explaining the rational method. Amongst his other themes Hofstadter does a great job of explaining Goedel's theorem.

### The Multi Orgasmic Couple
By Mantak Chia and Maneen Chia, Douglas Abrams and Rachel Abrams.

In very down to earth practical terms shows how both men and women can focus their minds and bodies to achieve multiple orgasms. Then goes on to show how partners can share that energy. If you have your doubts about sex being a spiritual exercise, try this book.

### All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten
By Robert Fulghum

Actually I would recommend any of Fulghum's books. He does a great job of talking in a very practical way about spiritual matters without resorting to the "God" word or invoking religion.
