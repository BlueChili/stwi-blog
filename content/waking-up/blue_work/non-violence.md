Let’s go all the way back to the time of Jesus. Blue insists he was the son of God as if that isn’t true for all of us. No, he was just a dude. But oh my what an enormous impact he had on the world. Please don’t hold against him the many later crimes committed in the name of Christianity. Let’s go back to the time when Christianity was just starting.

At that time, Rome was crushing most of the Western world in its brutal, slave empire. Israel had recently been conquered. Resistance was futile. And then there arose this crazy sect that taught people to love like they hadn’t loved before. Women and slaves were now beloved of God. In a sneaky act of subversion the cross which represents the most horrific death that we all fear — slow and painful, now instead became a symbol or redemption and hope. And this sect spread and grew and grew until three centuries later Rome finally capitulated and converted to Christianity. Rome fell to this new religion despite its desperate attempts to suppress it with violence. There were no victorious armies, no great battles waged, no conquering generals. Instead what arose was something new for this section of the world — Blue. Remember this stage is the reaction to Red. At times the only answer to Red’s violence is more violence. But Blue shows another way.

Jesus was apparently a great teacher.  What was he teaching? I think the core message was unconditional, universal love. That is a little hard to explain in just words. So let me tell you the story of my first awakening.

In my mid thirties, I developed a very dangerous and painful tumor in my spinal column. I was losing the ability to walk. Fortunately it was operable, but in removing the tumor, the surgeon had to remove a large chunk of the nerve connections to my left arm. One of my doctors looked at the body as a machine and was quite firm in telling me that there was no way I was going to regain the lost functionality. How could I? -- The nerves controlling it were completely removed. The actual surgeon, though, told me that we don't fully understand the body mind connection, and it is hard to predict exactly what could be re-established.

So after the surgery, in mourning, I consciously poured as much love as I could into my poor damaged arm and neck.  Later that night there was what felt like an angel’s kiss on my shoulder. The room filled with a tremendous wave of light and energy flowing first through me and then out through the rest of the room through the struggling patient next to me and then out into the whole world.  The feeling of oneness and wholeness was so powerful. When I remember the kiss I can only touch a small bit of it before getting overwhelmed. This kiss was not just for me, but for the struggling patient next to me and for the whole world. That is what I think Jesus (and all the other great teachers) was teaching. 

Now if you are struggling with my story, believe me, I sympathize. Please remember I was a devoted atheist at the time so I didn’t know what to make of it either. It threw everything I “knew” into disarray so I avoided even thinking too much about it for a time. But it changed me for every. I now know something that I didn’t before. Rationality is not the only source of truth. Which brings us back to Truth.
