We have not been in Yellow that long and yet I find myself already longing for the next level, Turqoise. After finding our vast strength in Yellow we start to really open up to all that is. And it hurts. Really hurts. The world is suffering in so many needless ways. My deepest desire is to help the world out of that suffering. As someone who is stepping into the Grandfather stage of his life, I am committed to leaving a safer world for all the grandchildren. I can't do it alone. I will need the help of many, many others. My wild hope is that after people have found their individual strength in Yellow they will then find they are up for the challenge of healing this world. And next they will look up and out to others and realize that we need a really big tribe to make this happen.

We don't really know yet exactly what Turquoise is going to look like. But we do have the pattern of what has happened up to now to give us some important clues. We know that this level will be the (tock) return to community. And just like Yellow is a hectave above Beige and revisits that level, Turquoise is a hectave above Purple. We will know Turquoise is here when people start to hold awesome, amazing parties. Burning Man might be an early example of that. Just like Purple was the start of religion, Turquoise almost certainly will see the rebirth of a new enlightened form of religion. It will be a practice of spirit that deeply nourishes and strengthens us. And we will become bad-asses once more.

I find it incredibly hopeful that this level is awakening exactly at the critical point where humanity chooses to either flourish or collapse. We have a choice. We already have enough food to feed the world, but we choose not to. We already have enough medicine to heal all the world's sick, but we choose not to. We already have the technology to completely stop C02 emissions, but we choose not to fully commit to it. Our root problem is the consciousness that we bring to this world.

Turquoise is like a prophecy in a story. It is a dream of what we hope and pray will come. And it can be our intention. Our guide of what needs to happen in order for the world to flourish. We need all the levels to make this dream work. We start back with Beige and welcome our primal connections with nature. We connect again deeply with our bodies, heal and embrace our sexuality, and find the first awakening within. Then in Purple we look to our tribe and spirit starts to fully awaken in us. Next in Red we find our warrior spirit. This dreams needs justice warriors who will protect it. After that in Blue we surrender to a Truth that is bigger than us. This is the ground we stand on. Orange lets us see the patterns of the world and reminds us that we are at choice even within that greater Truth. Green has us look to the suffering of others and the planet. We choose to care. It reminds us that Reason alone does not bring us to the full Truth. Yellow brings us to the sacred ground of ourselves. We do the deeper healing here and find our joy and full strength. And then finally, finally in Turquoise we look out to others who are also just now starting to look up and out. We are all leaders and we are all followers here. We share a goal. For the children we dare not hold back any part of ourselves. This is much bigger than ourselves. And we commit. All of me, All of you, All of us. Together we are one sacred whole. So it is. So it shall be.
