<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_Dynamics">Spiral Dynamics</a> is based on the research of the psychologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clare_W._Graves">Clare Graves</a> who was a contemporary of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Maslow">Abraham Maslov</a>. Both of whom were exploring all the stages of human development from the highest and lowest.  Clare Graves&rsquo;s health started to fail before he could fully develop his theory but his work was carried on by his younger colleagues <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Edward_Beck">Don Beck</a> and Chris Cowan. They took Grave&rsquo;s original theory and made it more accessible by adding things like color mnemonics. Ken Wilber took the theory and added it to his Integral Theory. He later on modified it to reflect his focus on individual, spiritual growth which is a different focus. I don&rsquo;t cover his variations on the theory here because I am more interested in focusing on the social applications. Although Spiral Dynamics is about individual developmental levels, from the very beginning it also has been applied to groups and organizations. Don Beck made many trips to South Africa to try and put Spiral Dynamics to practical use during the transition from Apartheid. He saw how this theory could transform the world. It is that focus that I am most interested in here.</p>
<p>Here is what I love about Spiral Dynamics:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It helps us understand why &ldquo;those&rdquo; people act as they do. Depending on what developmental level you are on, the world looks very different. To &ldquo;those&rdquo; people&rsquo;s point of view they are not doing anything wrong. In fact to them it is clear that it is &ldquo;us&rdquo; people who are the problem! When we better understand people it is possible to open our hearts to them. And that is when real change is possible. You learn to stop judging people as hopelessly stupid and evil, and instead meet them from within their world view.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The theory is a practical tool. It is meant to be of use. Please judge it by its practical benefits. It suggests concrete actions to deal with the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It teaches us to welcome all parts of ourselves. Even the parts that we resist. It is especially important to welcome those parts as well.  It reminds us of where we are strong and where we could use some work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It sets a concrete goal for where we need to go. If we can get enough people up to the final stage, the world will be transformed in an instant.  We are not yet at that final stage, but by looking at the patterns of what has happened up to now it gives us guidance on what likely wants to happen next.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The basic idea is that we all go through developmental stages. We start as infants and then slowly mature into adults with different growth stages along the way. The same can be said of human history. We started as animals and then have gone through and are still going through different historical developmental stages. Not everyone and not every society has gone through all the stages yet. Note that no stage is &ldquo;better&rdquo; than any other. Each is a complete, vast world unto itself that could easily consume a lifetime to explore. When we go up to a higher level it does not make us a &ldquo;better&rdquo; person. And we don&rsquo;t just throw away all the learnings of the previous level, we bring those learnings with us. However, each level does increase our skillfulness in the world. We see a little bit farther than before.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to take you through each of the historical stages. Lets start way back at the beginning.</p>
