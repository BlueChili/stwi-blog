In the Beige homework section I mainly suggested (or listening) to books. In Purple my suggestion is to now start doing this work with others. There is tremendous healing power in groups.

## Trauma
### Test
This is the big one. You almost certainly know on some level if you have had major trauma. What was your childhood like? Were you beaten or abused or maybe simply neglected? Those all can cause deep trauma. Have you been in a situation where people got killed and your own life was at risk? Have you been placed in an impossible situation where you had to do something unspeakable? Or maybe simply you grew up sensitive in a very harsh world. That all alone can cause deep trauma. Please don’t dismiss your trauma as less than others. It all hurts.
### Homework
The key thing is to get out of the story that there is nothing you can do. That is so no longer true! There are now lots of ways to treat trauma. But apparently that is not yet common knowledge. I watched an [exquisite movie][1] that had characters with horrific trauma wandering around zombie like in their lives. I watched the movie with mounting horror. It was like watching people with severe burns suffering horribly and not even realizing they could go to the hospitable and get medical help. Please don’t fall into that same trap.
Please read (or listen to) [The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma][2] by  Bessel van der Kolk. This is such an important book. It is the formal announcement that we no longer just have to suffer with trauma like those characters in that movie did. In the second half of this book Bessel talks about all of the different treatments for trauma. One that he is particularly excited about is MDMA talk therapy. This kind of treatment has you (after several initial preparatory talk sessions) do a “heroic” dose of MDMA and then do an extended talk session with a therapist. Please read up on this. If you have severe trauma it is the best treatment that I am aware of. But first I want you to investigate it. This kind of treatment is very close to [FDA approval][3] Unfortunately MDMA can be hard on the body so it won’t work for everyone.

## Self Compassion
In the Beige homework section I suggested reading  [Self Compassion; The proven power of being kind to yourself][4] by Kristin Neff. Your read it, right?  Please do. Books are great, but experiential learning is even better. Actually practicing the material with others is the way to go. Kristin helped set up a worldwide teaching institute for teaching self compassion called the [Center for Mindful Self Compassion][5]. They offer both intensive week long retreats as well as an 8 week program. I signed up twice for courses and twice they got cancelled due to Covid so I have not personally yet taken the course. But they look like great courses. So good that I have seriously considered going into their training program so that I can learn to teach the course. Note, if you can, sign up for a course in person. It was astonishing to me how much Zoom could handle during the pandemic, but in this kind of work it so much better to do it in person if you can.
