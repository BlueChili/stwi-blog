      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s start with Aaron Stark&amp;rsquo;s story.
  Do you see why it has to start here? There are so many, many children that could tell similar stories. This has to stop! These kids need our love and support. But instead just like in Aaron&amp;rsquo;s story the social worker buys into his mom&amp;rsquo;s well practiced lies and steps back and does nothing. Making the situation even worse than it was before.</description>

      <description>Non violence Mindfulness Mind/Body Truth Change Organicity Unity Loving Presence  Hakomi therapists are working to save the world. But here I am going to focus mainly on its principles. These principles are a foundation we can build on. They can be our North star to help guide us when we get lost. These principles work together. All of them are necessary. If a Hakomi session didn&amp;rsquo;t go well, students are taught to look to the principles to see what was missing.</description>

      <description>There sometimes is tremendous temptation to help people along by getting a little tough with them for their own good. Maybe hold them accountable for what they said they would do but didn&amp;rsquo;t. Maybe point them in the direction they need to go and push them a little. Some personal growth workshops take this approach and for a brief time people will have remarkable results. But the results don&amp;rsquo;t last. This is not the path to healing.</description>

      <description>Healing revolves around mindfulness. We encourage people to stop, take a breath, and really pay attention to what is going on with themselves. As people start to realize what a truly safe space they are in they feel safer to start exploring some of their scarier places. We gently remind them to close their eyes and really get in touch with how they are feeling. This is the core method.</description>

      <description>What happens in our body affects our Mind. What happens in our Mind affects our body. It is all one. HAI works very hard to get people deeply connected to their bodies. It is one of the major reasons why HAI invites people to take their clothes off. It is why we spend so much time stroking each other. Our culture has profound dysfunction around sexuality. Many of us have had wounding around our bodies or sex.</description>

      <description>We tend to get caught up in the strong currents of our emotions. The first step is mindful awareness of what is swirling around inside us. But then the next step is to get deeply curious. Why am I so angry? My goodness there is so much anger flowing through my body! I wonder what is going on here? What beliefs do I have about what just happened? Both HAI and Hakomi make a point to encourage people to get really curious about what is going on within themselves.</description>

      <description>Living organisms are always striving to grow and heal. Always. There might be something blocking it, but that is where things naturally want to go. We need to understand that our job is to step back and let it happen. We create a loving, safe learning environment and then have faith that people will find their own way to the healing they need. This is somewhat humbling. We are not the healers.</description>

      <description>There is a certain connection magic that always comes up for a group that goes through something intense together. People connect and become one. It is part of being human. We are a deeply social animal and we are meant to form groups both large and small. We even have mirror neurons dedicated to this task. If someone is grieving I grieve too. If someone is in pain I hurt also.</description>

      <title>Loving Presence</title>

      <description>This is the base. Everything has to be built on top of this. In Hakomi we were taught to build a loving &amp;ldquo;bubble&amp;rdquo; between ourselves and our client. In HAI it comes from the deep love from the facilitators and the team. They are all there because they are deeply committed to love and together they create the same &amp;ldquo;bubble&amp;rdquo; but for an entire room. The very first thing the facilitators do is to model loving, tender connection with each other.</description>
