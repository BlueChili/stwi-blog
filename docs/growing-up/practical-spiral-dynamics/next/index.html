<main><h1>Putting Spiral Dynamics to work</h1>
<p>Spiral Dynamics gives us a better story. It helps us put into context all that has happened. We can step out of helpless victim and into problem solving mode. We see all the stages and recognize both their shadows and gifts. It breaks down the problem for us into more manageable chunks. Spiral Dynamics offers a path. How do we save the world? We help people move into higher and higher stages. How do we help people move into higher stages? That is what I am going to talk about next. Let&rsquo;s take one more spin through all the stages to consider what needs to be done.</p>
<h2 id="beige">Beige</h2>
<p>So many people are collapsed down to the survival level. They are leading quiet lives of desperation. Just barely able to make it each day. Sometimes this is because they are brutally poor. Sometimes because they are refugees of famine or war. And in the U.S an unbelievably high number of people are trauma victims. People are so traumatized that they can barely lead their lives. This is common! We have to stop this. If it were up to me I would direct at least the amount of money that we spend on defense instead towards defense of our children. We have to start here. We can not move forward with so, so many hurting people. This is the work of Healing Up. I will start on that in the next section.</p>
<h2 id="purple">Purple</h2>
<p>Very few people are at authentic Purple. We have done much too good a job of conquering the world to let them survive. And that is too our vast loss. Purple has a lot to teach us. Why am I so confident of this? Because it already has. America is a democracy partly (maybe even largely?) because of the impact Native American (Purple) intellectuals had on our society. Find yourself skeptical about that? Please read the book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dawn_of_Everything">The Dawn of Everything</a>. An anthropologist and archaeologist teamed up to do the careful, painstaking scholarship needed to completely upend the existing myths about early societies. It turns out that Purple societies lived in large egalitarian cities for thousands of years. They used clever, sustainable agriculture that did not require excessive amounts of labor. And they knew about Red, and consciously chose systems of government to prevent the empire of Red from arising again. They had learned from hard experience what was necessary to lead free and full lives. This is what the Native American intellectuals had to teach the settlers. But the settlers only took part of the message. We still have much more to learn. We will come back to this when we talk about the work of Wising Up.</p>
