<main><h1>Cleaning Up</h1><p>Let&rsquo;s start Cleaning Up by visiting the stink spirit video from Spirited Away again. If you haven&rsquo;t watched it yet please consider <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FansOfStudioGhibli/videos/spirited-away-bathhouse-clip/493650414055324/">watching it now</a>.</p>
<p>We all have a lifetime of accumulated junk that is keeping us from our true shining nature. Notice how much courage and fortitude is needed just to get started. It feels kind of hopeless. I&rsquo;m not worth the effort! But the pain keeps driving us forward. I love how the whole community rallies to help with the cleaning up. I&rsquo;ve had a community stand up for me too. I could not get there all on my own. We can&rsquo;t get there all on our own.</p>
<p>Back when I was so much in pain I did what was for me a desperate act. I asked for help. I knew I could not get their on my own so I signed up for an intensive set of personal growth workshops. The first weekend was designed to open us up to the work and the second, longer retreat was where we did the real work. That retreat was called &ldquo;The Wall&rdquo; and it was named after the &ldquo;wall&rdquo; that runners hit and then keep on going. It was described as a chasm mountain climbers might find on their path. Giving them no real choice other than to leap over the chasm. And in that moment when they are in the air a moment of new possibility might open up.</p>
<p>All the workshop participants met at Sea-Tac airport to take a bus to a remote camp somewhere in Washington state. We didn&rsquo;t really know exactly where, really. We stayed in bunkbeds and were woken up at 6am to the shrill whistle of our facilitator dressed as a coach and were set out on our daily run. Which was timed. Fairly early in the retreat the facilitator asked us to commit to our life purpose. And if we didn&rsquo;t already know our life purpose he suggested we take on the purpose of living a deep, rich, fulfilling life. He asked us to take a walk out into nature to really think about this commitment over before making it. After our walks we came back to our meeting cabin and the facilitator said, &ldquo;Everyone who is willing to commit to their life purpose please stand.&rdquo; Everyone stood but me. I looked around a little in amazement &ndash; how could everyone so easily stand? It didn&rsquo;t seem fair. This was way too early in the retreat. Didn&rsquo;t people understand what they were commiting to? This was it. If I commited to this everything else was a detail. Hard, difficult details, but honestly? details.</p>
<p>I had only recently returned from Japan and I was still married to my Japanese wife. We now lived in Washington State. She was a deeply wounded woman and was both emotionally and physically (at times) abusive to both me and our son. I was stumping along on duty and would have secretly welcomed a death by cancer as an honorable way out. I didn&rsquo;t have much, but at the time my word was impeccable. If I said I would do something, I really would.</p>
