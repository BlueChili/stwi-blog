Theory is a great place to start, but how do we put it to use? I think Valerie Kaur's [Revolutionary Love Project](https://valariekaur.com/revolutionary-love-project/) is a great example of all the colors in play.

First, please watch the video:

I'm pretty sure Valerie does not know about Spiral Dynamics, but that doesn't matter because she definitely makes skillful use of all the color levels.

She starts out with the pain of giving birth. And her family is there with her, primal Beige.
She has a vision of all the mothers before her in a long line, perfect Purple.
Her Grandfather admonishes her to be a warrior. "You will not abandon the fight. Don't abandon your post", healthy Red.
She talks about how her Sikh religion has guided her, beautiful Blue.
She talks a little about how the lawyer part of herself is a little uncomfortable with all this love talk, classic Orange
She talks about her social justice work, amazing vibrant Green
She talks about her inner work of learning to love herself, awakening Yellow
And then she looks up from herself to call all of us to join her, triumphant Turqoise
