      <title>Truth</title>

      <description>Healing work demands we find our truth. Hakomi gently guides clients deeper and deeper into a non ordinary state of consciousness that helps them get all the way down to their core beliefs. These are the (mostly) unconscious beliefs people have about how the world works. What is and is not safe. These beliefs are usually created by a child desperately trying to survive against unfair odds. So we honor the genius of that child for finding something that worked, but then help them see how that solution also came with a price.</description>

      <description>When I was 15 I started to develop huge cystic acne cysts. They would swell so big that they stretched the skin of my face and made it painful to smile. They grew almost to the size of ping pong balls &amp;ndash; I am not exaggerating. I went from one of the cuter boys to one of the ugliest just like that. And in my bewildered pain I made a choice to protect myself.</description>

      <title>Mindfulness</title>

      <description>There is a lot of truly great writing about mindfulness. For example, Mark Manson has an excellent article here. He writes in his vivid way of all the amazing benefits both health-wise and mental. But in that article he lightly touches upon something that is often overlooked. We tend to think of meditation as the only way to cultivate mindfulness. It is not. Meditation is not the answer to all our problems.</description>

      <title>Mind/Body</title>

      <description>We have this weird illusion that somehow our body is separate from our mind. As if they are separate things. What a strange story we tell ourselves. It is so not true. What happens in our body affects our Mind. What happens in our Mind affects our body. It is all one. When we suffer a traumatic event we store that trauma somewhere in our body. In his book The body keeps the score, the psychiatrist Bessel van der Kolk talks about how when he first started out as a therapist working with traumatized people, his profession didn&amp;rsquo;t have much to offer.</description>

      <description>I don’t think people are seeking the meaning of life as much as they are seeking the experience of being alive.” Joseph Campbell
 &amp;ldquo;Organicity&amp;rdquo; is an unfamiliar, awkward word, and I have to confess I initially resisted it. But that resistance was mostly because it is awkward to learn something truly new. Ignore what the dictionary might say, in this sense the word combines &amp;ldquo;organism&amp;rdquo; with &amp;ldquo;icity&amp;rdquo; to mean the nature of an organism.</description>

      <description>There is a certain connection magic that always comes up for a group that goes through something intense together. People connect and become one. It is part of being human. We are a deeply social animal and we are meant to form groups both large and small. We even have mirror neurons dedicated to this task. If someone is grieving I grieve too. If someone is in pain I hurt also.</description>
