One of my favorite memories is sitting next to a man at a BDSM “munch” (monthly gathering) and talking about his corset pictures. We were conspiring to attract one of the female doms that he wanted to do a play session with. I loved the frank honesty of the munch group — they were clear what worked for them sexually and were honest about it. I also loved how it was so clear that whether you liked to dominate or submit was not tied to gender.
