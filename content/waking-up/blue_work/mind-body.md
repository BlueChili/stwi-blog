I don’t know about more recent generations, but in my generation we absolutely did not talk about masturbation. It was shameful and wrong. The surgeon general, [Dr Joycelyn Elders][1] was promptly fired when she said that masturbation was healthy, normal, and should be taught in school. No one questioned Clinton getting rid of her — of course she had to be fired! 

So let’s talk about masturbation.

First of all, what a beautiful even potentially sacred act of self love. I don’t always treat it like that of course. Quite often it is just a simple body comfort and I do it watching porn. But I also have a conscious masturbation practice. I think everyone should. 

Most people are under the mistaken notion that male ejaculation and orgasm are inseparable. This turns out to not be true. It is absolutely possible for men to have mind blowing, screaming orgasms without ejaculation. I regularly do. How? I read a book by [Manta Chia][2] about gaining control over our energy flows. Sounds a bit woo woo right? But it is very, very real. It took a lot of practice and many, many failed attempts, but what enjoyable practice!  The first step is to get really present to the different stages of arousal and recognize when I’m just at the very, very brink of orgasm. Then I do two things. I contract my kegels to hold off the spurt, but I also switch my internal energy flow. One interesting side effect is that because I’m so attuned now to the different stages of arousal, I can also bring my lover to the very edge of orgasm and have her coast there for a long time. It helps to deepen and prolong the orgasm when it finally comes. And the same for me. It used to be that when I orgasmed it was a brief intense squirt that was kind of disappointing. Now my orgasms are so much better. I’m astonished how many men still have not taken this practice on. Many have never even heard of this.

This is all very nice you might be thinking, but why bring it up here? Because when I talk about working with spirit I am not talking about some abstract entity that likes to throw thunderbolts from time to time. I’m talking about something that lives in our body right now. It is right there in every breath, and in every bite of food we take. It is right there when hold our child, or feel that familiar awful dread in our belly. It is right there. Mantak Chia taught me to really feel the energy flows in my body and learn to consciously control them. Energy workers when they work with me almost immediately realize, “Oh! — you are running kundalini energy right?”. Yes, that is exactly what I’m doing. When I allow it, I am having a [kundalini awakening][3].  For me I experience that as a body sense of the divine that is our everything if only we let ourselves know it.

This body sense can come in many ways. For me it also comes in music and dance. There are a beautiful, gentle group of churches under the name Center For Spiritual Living (CSL). I will come back to them in Green, because they are a very Green church. Because of that they are very safe for atheists to go to. I liked the sermons, but what I particularly liked was the music of the Seattle CSL. They were flourishing at that time and had incredible, powerful music each Sunday. I found myself standing up in testament to their music. Standing even when I was the only one, because it moved me so much. This is not a CSL song, but it captures the spirit:

As you watch this, please consider standing up and dancing. And know that as you dance I dance with you and you are surrounded by so many others just letting their body feel this. Sometimes words just won’t do. You have to dance it out.

And when you really feel it all the way, then the thing that wants to happen, organicity, just flows. Back to that now.
