What happens in our body affects our Mind. What happens in our Mind affects our body. It is all one. And when we have a trauma we store that trauma somewhere in our body. In his book [The body keeps the score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Body_Keeps_the_Score), the psychiatrist  Bessel van der Kolk talks about how when he started working with traumatized people his profession didn't have much to offer. They didn't even really recognize that PTSD was a real thing. That has changed. In the second half of his book he talks about the many, many different and promising therapy options for traumatized people we have now. This is huge. Maybe for the first time since the start of Red empire we have the chance to finally stop that cycle of one generation passing it's trauma on to the next. 

And as different as these options are they do share one thing -- a way to help people to connect their bodies back into the world.


HAI works very hard to get people deeply connected to their bodies. It is one of the major reasons why HAI invites people to take their clothes off. It is why in HAI exercises people spend so much time stroking each other. Our culture has profound dysfunction around sexuality. Many of us have had wounding around our bodies or sex. By releasing some of that shame we can more fully inhabit our bodies.

Medicine work takes us into our bodies in a way most of us have never experienced. Takes us into that wild subconscious that we up to now have only seen glimpses of.
