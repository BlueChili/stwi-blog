Coming back from a deep Medicine psychedelic journey can be hard. We usually really struggle at the beginning to surrender to the medicine, but once we do we quite often end up in a beautiful spot. Maybe we  wrap our arms around an angel and blast to another planet, or maybe we die and find ourself in a world of peaceful joy where our painful body no longer troubles us. It can be hard to come back from that. The key healing work for the client is integrating all this new experience. The initial journey is great, but it is in the follow up sessions with the therapist where usually the important work is done. The client now knows what is possible â€” the work is to fully bring it into themself and live from that place.

Hakomi is less dramatic, but the principle is the same. The therapist helps a client find the internal change needed (usually a changed story about themselves), and then helps them really ground in the joy of that change. Helps them feel all the way in their body how good and right it feels. Then encourages them to really own this new way of being. Again just like with Medicine work the key thing here is to have the client integrate this change into themselves and make it a part of them self.
