First they overcome their fears and limitations, and then they commit. Then they work through their bitter squabbles and commit to each other. I want to be like them. I\u0026amp;rsquo;m hoping you do too, because the world is in desperate need of heroes right now.\nPolice kill black men seemingly at will. Large parts of the population seem to be indifferent to the needless deaths and suffering of a million people. And it gets worse. Global warming is here and we are burning. Species are dying in numbers we can barely comprehend. In our children\u0026amp;rsquo;s lifetimes it is possible large parts of the planet might become uninhabitable. If we don\u0026amp;rsquo;t make drastic changes, it is possible that billions of people will die. Seriously.\nStill with me? I don\u0026amp;rsquo;t blame you if your first instinct is to stop reading. If you let yourself really consider how bad things could get it is just too overwhelming. Billions of people dying? Surely that is hysterical hyperbole? It is just too much. Sadly it is a real possibility.\nThere is Hope But please know this. There is hope. Really and truly. It is not going to be easy of course. It never is in dire situations like this. And unlike the movies there is no guarantee that everything will work out in the end. But I wouldn\u0026amp;rsquo;t be writing this if I did not truly believe there is hope.\nAgain it is not going to be easy. No heroic journey ever is. Are you willing to at least start? The very first step is to embrace the pain. Really let yourself feel how awful this is. Yuck! Why would you want to do that? Because with pain comes a precious gift \u0026amp;ndash; the energy to do whatever it takes to get out of that pain. The bigger the pain the bigger the gift that comes with it. Think about times in your life when something hurt so bad that you just had to make a drastic change. That pain gave you the energy to make a change you might not …","date":1599434191,"description":"","lastmod":"2020-09-06T16:16:31-07:00","objectID":"6d2f71d94c1faa6e60c4af21ce1d33ef","permalink":"https://turquoise-community.github.io/save-the-world/posts/save-the-world/","publishdate":"2020-09-06T16:16:31-07:00","title":"Save the World"},{"content":"But first we need a plan. Our current approach is not working. There are many things not working, but let me focus on climate change because it is a huge problem. Emissions keep on going up. World wide agreements are made, but never for enough and emissions keep on going up. Environmentalists pin their hope on elections but then the other party gets elected and dismantles previous work. And emissions keep on going up.\nWhy don\u0026amp;rsquo;t they get the importance of climate change? How can they not understand how important this is? Or if they do understand why is it not more of a priority? What can be more important than saving the world? If a meteor was on a collision course with the earth surely that would capture people\u0026amp;rsquo;s attention, so why not this?\nI have an explanation, but first let\u0026amp;rsquo;s start with an experiment. Take a moment to get settled and become aware of what is going on for you. Maybe take a breath, relax and pause for a moment here. Then when you are ready read the next sentence, and pay really close attention to what happens for you.\nThe very worst part of the climate change disaster is probably eighty or more years away.\nNow be honest with yourself. Doesn\u0026amp;rsquo;t that ease your concern at least a little? Eighty years is an awfully long time away, and most of us won\u0026amp;rsquo;t be alive then. But then you might argue that even right now we are suffering the effects of climate change. True the danger of billions of people dying is a long way off, but there is plenty of suffering to worry about in our immediate future. Yes, but now notice again how it feels when I reframe the above statement and say that billions might die in our children\u0026amp;rsquo;s life time. Notice how that feels different. It feels different because I have brought the issue closer into your sphere of compassion.\nWe all have spheres of compassion. The things in our inner sphere are the things we care most about and will protect. Typically your family is in this inner sphere. Then there …","date":1599434191,"description":"","lastmod":"2020-09-06T16:16:31-07:00","objectID":"516d4f7369653d2fe1cbecbefc66d823","permalink":"https://turquoise-community.github.io/save-the-world/posts/we-need-a-plan/","publishdate":"2020-09-06T16:16:31-07:00","title":"Spheres of compassion"},{"content":"index page stuff here\n","date":1508253975,"description":"","lastmod":"2017-10-17T15:26:15Z","objectID":"439680883c1b56d1b134767b123ba4a4","permalink":"https://turquoise-community.github.io/save-the-world/stone-soup/","publishdate":"2017-10-17T15:26:15Z","title":"Stone soup"},{"content":"Stone Soup \u0026amp;ndash; stone soup text goes here \u0026amp;mdash; edited\n","date":1606327471,"description":"","lastmod":"2020-11-25T10:04:31-08:00","objectID":"a23185fd886f057940397cf65cc6f0c6","permalink":"https://turquoise-community.github.io/save-the-world/stone-soup/stone-soup/","publishdate":"2020-11-25T10:04:31-08:00","title":"Stone Soup1"},{"content":"welcome index page stuff here\n","date":1508253975,"description":"","lastmod":"2017-10-17T15:26:15Z","objectID":"13078024304187af879d3faeabcc8cae","permalink":"https://turquoise-community.github.io/save-the-world/welcome/","publishdate":"2017-10-17T15:26:15Z","title":"Welcome"},{"content":"Welcome! Thank you so much visiting this web site! I\u0026amp;rsquo;m just at the very beginning of this project and I need all the help I can get to make this something that serves.\nKnow that it was very hard for me to ask you to come visit something that is so rough and unfinished. I truly am deeply grateful that you did! Please also know that I will treasure any feedback you can give me. My intent is to as much as possible get my own ego out of the way so that I can \u0026amp;ndash; with your help \u0026amp;ndash; create something that actually helps the world. That is what is most important to me. So really let me know what you truly think, both good and bad.\nI have a wild ambition to save the world. To even have a chance to make this work it will require many, many different voices speaking from a place of deep Truth. We all have our own paths to Truth let\u0026amp;rsquo;s start with mine.\nSave the World There is so much suffering and pain in the world. When I open my heart to all that is I burst into sobbing tears. So. much. Pain! Do you feel it with me? At least a little? The sensitives among us certainly do. Here take this pill so you can function, as if shock and horror were not the most appropriate reaction to the world. As if everything is fine, just keep on going don\u0026amp;rsquo;t pay attention to that poor homeless person in the corner there. And our history! Generation after generation passing its trauma on to the next. So many people growing up in hurt and lack. It hurts so much! It can feel like much too much to take in, even just a little bit can feel like the an immense, implacable ocean wave sweeping us away from the security of shore. Better, safer to hide away from all that pain.\nThen to find out that we are killing off most of the species on this planet, setting up a future catastrophe that could cause billions to die, and most people don\u0026amp;rsquo;t seem to really care. Don\u0026amp;rsquo;t seem to realize it for the existential threat that it is. It is easy to give in to a sort of hopelessness. …","date":1606327471,"description":"","lastmod":"2020-11-25T10:04:31-08:00","objectID":"11a8f9be7d8c38f16f9381114394dea9","permalink":"https://turquoise-community.github.io/save-the-world/welcome/welcome/","publishdate":"2020-11-25T10:04:31-08:00","title":"Welcome"}]
