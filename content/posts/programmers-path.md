I'm curious to know if there is interest in this. It is kind of an amusing thing to think about. How could engineers have anything to contribute to the conversation of waking up to a bigger consciousness? And yet I think we do.

Post a message if you might be interested in me writing this up. Right now I am focused on the main path and this is definitely not that.

Here is the outline of what I would want to cover:

- Software engineer path
  - Radical truth
    - Running in debug mode
    - Embrace when you are wrong
    - Measuring
  - Learning to be wrong
    - It is a practice
    - Needs to be supported
    - OK to aspire to excellence anyways
  - Check your assumptions
    - debugging leads to this
    - examine sources of truth
  - Dealing with complexity
    - simplify
    - layers
    - scrum
      - negotiating complexity
      - not everyone has to be a software expert
  - Deep dive
    - Five whys
    - Failure without blame
    - Factoring in that humans are failable
  - Flow
    - Cure for sensitivity
      -hiding out in the crystalline, beautiful forests of reason
    - Teaches possibility of joy
      - joy based life
  - Request For Comments (RFC)
    - Courageous asks that can change the world
  - Models
  - Open source
    - Shared libraries
    - Forking
    - Not all opinions are equal

### Five Whys
