>I don’t think people are seeking the meaning of life as much as they are seeking the experience of being alive.”
Joseph Campbell

"Organicity" is an unfamiliar, awkward word, and I have to confess I initially resisted it. But that resistance was mostly because it is awkward to learn something truly new. Ignore what the dictionary might say, in this sense the word combines "organism" with "icity" to mean the nature of an organism. It focuses us on the living, natural organisms that we all are. We tend to skip right past that, but this principle brings us back over and over to the miracle of life. Brings us back to noticing what our living body is feeling and longing for. Living things are always healing. Always. Isn't that amazing? A doctor might set a broken bone, but then it is up to the body to do the healing. A Hakomi therapist might help a client discover that a story they are telling themselves no longer serves, but then it is up to the client to embrace the new story that does.

When a 17 year old girl who I was very close to died I was devasted. A wise grief counselor told me that we are never the same after our losses, but to know that we are always on a path towards healing. Always. I found that incredibly comforting and true. There might be something blocking it, but health is where things naturally want to go. Hakomi teaches us to step back and let that healing happen. We create a loving, safe learning environment and then have faith that people will find their own way. For the therapist this is quite humbling. We are not the healers. We are merely facilitating a healing environment. We have to surrender control -- it is a leap of faith.  We trust that people know their own way to healing, and we are just helping them find it. I struggled with this. It was surprisingly hard to simply ask my client "What wants to happen next?", and to trust that something may come to them or not and either way it was OK. I had this mistaken notion that I needed to constantly direct things. But that is not how healing works -- it always comes from within.

This is also a core belief of AFNT. They train us in the Way of the Guide. We are taught to not come in with expectations, in fact to not even have a hope because even that can set up an expectation that can be disappointed. Over and over we are reminded that it is the Forest that holds the answers, we are just opening the door. We learn to trust that clients will have exactly the interaction with the Forest that they need in that particular moment. Again every organism innately knows what is best for it. That includes us -- we are all organisms too.

We start by creating the safe space within (non-violence), then we simply get curious (truth), and start to watch ourselves carefully (mindfulness). That leads us to be here right now in our body (mind-body) and next we see what wants to happen next (organicity). We trust that our heart, mind, and body will lead us. And where will they lead us? We don't know, but we do know it will be something maybe very different than what we have right now. It will be a change.
