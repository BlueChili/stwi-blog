Change is messy and scary so we resist with all our might. But it is what we have to do. We can stay blocked for years and years, but organicity is always striving towards health and eventually something has to give. Let me give an example.

I was in Gautemala with my ex-wife for a month and midway through my testosterone prescription ran out. I couldn't get a refill but it turns out that Guatemalan pharmacies will sell you pretty much anything they have without the need for a prescription. And they had this high quality testosterone made in Switzerland. Apparently you did just one injection and then you were good for a month. That sounded pretty good -- the daily cream application was a hassle. So I had my ex inject me one night and we went to bed. I woke up in the early hours of the morning and I knew everything had to change. Everything. My ex suffered from extreme anxiety and she constantly was hit with crippling migraines that would keep her in bed for days. She felt a desperate need to control the world because it felt like her very survival was at stake. We had fallen into a bad pattern where she pretty much controlled everything about our lives. Even in the bedrooom she would control moment what happened during the infrequent times we were sexual. I went along with all this because I loved her and wanted to help, but it didn't work for either of us.

Early early that morning I woke up and took a long walk. I passed through the markets the Guatemalans have before they set up the tourist market and all the while I had this strong knowing that everything had to change.
