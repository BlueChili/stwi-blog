Despite the angel’s kiss I didn’t suddenly declare myself spiritual. So how did I start to awaken?

 After the initial power and glory of it, I tried to go back to my life as a software engineer. A life that did not have any room for spirit in it. I knew on some level that I was not an atheist any more but I didn’t really want to think about it. It was too much. Over many years (again this would have been greatly speed up if I had just done the process consciously) I would recognize from time my spiritual intuitions coming up. And eventually I just started to allow them. Maybe not for very long, but I started to just allow that I had now another way of looking at the world. Then I let myself start to investigate what these spiritual longings were all about, and the fear that came up with them.

I needed a little nurturing around the fear, but what I needed most was to really trust myself. To trust that this new way of looking at the world was just as valid as anything my rational mind came up with. To really trust that I loved myself way too much to ever forsake the rational/logical side of myself. Even as I started to venture off into these new worlds of spirit, I promises myself over and over that I would not forsake the other parts of me. This is the nurture/need step. It was so necessary.  It let me start to integrate this whole new world of spirit. It let me accept that I am extremely intuitive and can at times sense people’s energy. I started to integrate this spiritual side of me. Really let myself bring both spirit and rationality into how I decide if something is true. And I realized that I was not just the rationalist or someone having a spiritual awakening. I was both and more. And I started to get curious, just how big am I? Just how big is everyone if they only knew? And then I go back to gratitude for finding all of this. What a gift. What a gift all of this is. I’m so very grateful.

Finding your connection with spirit, is a very personal thing. No one can do it for you. You first need to be open to the possibility of spirit even existing. If your heart and mind are firmly closed to it then it won’t happen. That is where I was at after my Angel’s kiss. Even though I now had overwhelming evidence of spirit, it was just too much. I packed it into a box and stacked it way, way back in the closet of my mind. But bits and pieces of it kept on leaking out. And then more. This took many years, and honestly it still is too much for me to fully accept, but I’m no longer hiding from it. 


I’m presenting this now as a very smooth process, but it was not anything like that of course. And oddly the thing that most helped me return to spirit was a masturbation technique. Weird right? But it almost always our body that guides the way. Let’s go back there next.
