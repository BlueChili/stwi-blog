When I first started telling people the Spiral Dynamics story I hoped it would wake them up to Turquoise all by it self. But nope. Most people are not quite ready yet. I feel like a popcorn kernel that has popped a little earlier than the rest. I hope and pray that it is just a matter of time before the rest of the kernels start popping so I can nestle in with them, but in the meantime it looks like I have some work to do.

I want people to end up where I am. How did I get to this point? I found a number of wise schools to guide me. I was asked to seriously commit to a rich, deeply fulfilling life. And I did. I now awaken each morning to joy. Then I was taught to find something bigger than myself, and then finally I woke up to what I am called to do. This is a powerful path to walk. Please walk with me.

Do you remember the initial plan?

* Growing Up
* Cleaning Up
  * Healing up
  * Wising Up
* Waking Up
* Showing Up

We have been working on Growing Up. I started here because without a coherent story we are stumbling around blind. Blue religions tell us to just trust God and everything will be fine. It won't be. Orange scientists understand global warming but not people. Green activists understand the deep injustices of the world, but not how to fix it. Not really. Yellow seekers see no alternative but to watch the world burn. It doesn't occur to them to join with others. So we have to waken Turquoise but even that is not enough. The Spiral Dynamic stages are just one relatively small part of who we are. We are much bigger than that. We are bigger than our story, bigger than our fears. If we can get people out of survival mode and into the vast place of self-actualization we will change the world.

So how do we do that? Cleaning Up, Waking Up, and Showing Up.

Cleaning Up gives us a deep rich fulfilling life. We get there by spiraling back to Beige and Purple. Beige guides us back to our bodies. Guides us to our connection with nature and our sexuality. This is where work with our trauma and wounds. This is the Healing Up part of Cleaning Up. Purple puts us in a healing community that supports and inspires us to grow. It provides a culture that encourages us to take on healthier, wiser life practices. We are never done with this growth work. This is the Wising Up part of Cleaning Up. It seems to work best to mix the two. We do a little healing work which then inspires us to become a little wiser which then enables us to do some more healing work. Until one day we look up and realize we are in joy.

Waking Up is about stepping into something bigger than ourselves. This is the other side of Purple -- it can awaken us to spirit.

Showing Up is about figuring out what we came to Earth to do. And once we get really clear on that we will also get clear that we can not do it alone. We need others to wake up to what it is they are here for and then for them too to realize they can't get there on just their own. We are going to have to get there together. We need to come together as one in community.

This place of sacred community lets us bring all parts of us forward. We bring our vibrant animal natures (Beige). We create sustainable, loving community (Purple). We step into those incredibly challenging conversations and confrontations (Red). We commit to those wild dreams of something greater than ourselves (Blue). We honor the beautiful Truth of science and reason to see more clearly (Orange). We tend to the wounds of the oppressed and reclaim our natural equality (Green). We hone our Spiral wizardry to meet people where they are and actually get stuff done (Yellow). We wake up to our full strength and then look out to others (Turquoise). And then just maybe we can step into that [more beautiful world our hearts know is possible](https://charleseisenstein.org/books/the-more-beautiful-world-our-hearts-know-is-possible/).

Next step? Cleaning Up
