> “People will only protect what they love.”
 Jacques Cousteau

When I found out my beloved partner was maybe falling in love with another man I went through wild, manic swings. One moment I was pouring all my heart and soul into figuring out a way to fix it. Then I would get so angry I would clench my fists and shout. Then I got so sad that I couldn’t sleep. I went so many nights without sleep that when I shut my eyes I had vivid hallucinations. I’ve aways thought “heart breaking” was a poetic term. Nope, turns out it is a very real, physical thing. Where my love for her used to be was now a million scattered pieces of heart. Maybe I don’t love her anymore I told myself. Then I really let myself explore leaving her, and the pain got so much I didn’t know if I could bear it. We have created such a great life together, and created so many great memories. Sure I could probably find someone else, but I really don’t want to. To make it even more crazy making she is walking the El Camino in Spain for 8 weeks while this all blew up so we are physically distant. I sent her an angry email and was quite surprised that that didn’t immediately have her come running to me. Instead she told me she needed to process and pulled back from communicating with me except for brief superficial texts.

I waited day after day for her to come back to connection with me. And each day I got more and more desperate.  So I really pulled back my heart. Of course I did. This hurt too much.  But one day it suddenly hit me — I made a sacred vow to love everyone, no kidding no exceptions. I was so not honoring that vow. But it was so very hard for me step back into love with her. The perfect cosmic synchronicity that I just so happen to be writing about loving the hard things at the exact moment I am so angry at someone blows my mind. So I reread some of my articles here to remind me of who I am when I’m in my higher place.  And then I surrendered to how deeply I really love her. I love her with all my heart. I love her beyond beyond. She was my soulmate, the one I was going to die with. And I really stepped into the pain of losing that security that I was her one and only.  That opened up a rush of energy and love. Turns out that choosing to hold back my love was even more painful than that initial hurt. Choosing love just feels so much better. I chose love not because it is the right thing to do (although it is), and not because it is what the world needs (although it does). In this case I chose love because it is the selfish path to joy for myself. When I don’t chose love I step into pain. Choosing love steps me into that bigger place in myself that feels amazing.
