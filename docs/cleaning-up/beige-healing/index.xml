      <description>Huge acne cysts sprang up on my face at the end of my sophomore year in high school. They swelled so big that my skin was pulled painfully tight and made it hard to smile. They were almost as big as ping pong balls &amp;ndash; I am not exaggerating. And when they finally, finally popped tthey left very big, deep, pitted scars. And they kept on coming. I went from one of the cuter boys to one of the ugliest just like that.</description>

      <description>If we want to heal we have to find our deeper truths. Hakomi gently guides clients deeper and deeper into a non ordinary state of consciousness that helps them get all the way down to their core beliefs. These are the (mostly) unconscious beliefs people have about how the world works. What is and is not safe. These beliefs are usually created by a child desperately trying to survive against unfair odds.</description>

      <description>As I have been writing this section, I have had a urinary infection that made it painful to pee. I kept on ignoring and ignoring it for two weeks. Finally it finally got so painful even I could no longer ignore it so I went into urgent care and got a prescription that cleared me up pretty much in one day. Why did I wait so long? Now with the infection gone I realize how much it was weighing on me.</description>

      <description>I don’t think people are seeking the meaning of life as much as they are seeking the experience of being alive.” Joseph Campbell
 &amp;ldquo;Organicity&amp;rdquo; is an unfamiliar, awkward word, and I have to confess I initially resisted it. My partner especially dislikes it but try as we might we can&amp;rsquo;t come up with an alternative. We really do need a new word here. Ignore what the dictionary might say, in this sense the word combines &amp;ldquo;organism&amp;rdquo; with &amp;ldquo;icity&amp;rdquo; to mean the nature of an organism.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;All human behavior is either an act of love or a cry for love&amp;rdquo; Stan Dale
  “The hardest to learn was the least complicated” Indigo Girls
 Let&amp;rsquo;s go back to Aaron Stark&amp;rsquo;s story about how he almost became a school shooter. What saved him? Simply a friend&amp;rsquo;s undemanding love. The friend wasn&amp;rsquo;t trying to fix him, he just wanted to spend time with him. Even though Aaron had lied to him and stolen from him, his friend was still there.</description>

      <description>There is a certain connection magic that always comes up for a group that goes through something intense together. People connect and become one. It is part of being human. We are a deeply social animal and we are meant to form groups both large and small. We even have mirror neurons dedicated to this task. If someone is grieving I grieve too. If someone is in pain I hurt also.</description>
