I recently watch a movie called Manchester by the Sea. The movie has amazing acting and is quite well done. But I don‚Äôt recommend it. At all. I think the movie has the best possible intentions, but never the less it promotes a very dangerous world view. Why am I so upset about this movie? Because it portrays deeply, deeply traumatized people stumbling around causing harm to themselves and others without any recognition that it doesn‚Äôt have to be like that. The movie perpetuates the harmful story that there is nothing you can do about deep trauma.  It is as if the actors portrayed burn victims just making do with their festering wounds and just accepting that it had to be that way. Hospitals?!? Pfff. As if. Real people just suffer. This is dangerous, ignorant nonsense. But it is understandable that the movie makers bought into this nonsense. Up to now that is all we knew. We have only recently rediscovered what Purple knew all along ‚Äî we can heal trauma. But we have to first accept that this is even possible. And then we have to surrender and give up much of what we ‚Äúknow‚Äù in order to change. That is terrifying and we need support.

I keep on coming back to [The Body Keeps the Score][1] (you are going to read this book right? üòâ) because it is so foundational. He does such a good job of showing how pervasive and damaging trauma is, but then gives us such hope! The second half lists many, many different promising approaches to trauma. Pretty much all of them have you reconnect to your body. A surprising number of them involve coordinated group work (yoga, dance, singing). And they are helping! I personally have seen how just one of these listed therapies, MDMA, can dramatically help. Probably the biggest work we have to do here is to simply get the word out. If I could rewrite Manchester by the Sea I would show the main character going into MDMA treatment and follow them as they go up and down through the difficult healing process. It would be cathartic to watch ‚Äî lots of crying involved ‚Äî and I promise you very compelling. People need to know this healing is possible. To start that awful story we have that there is nothing you can do. The second thing we need to do is to scale up these treatments and make them much cheaper. We need these treatments available to everyone ‚Äî everyone needs to be able to afford them. And this has to be our priority. This is the change that needs to happen.

The [The Body Keeps the Score][2] also talks about the healing power of creativity. Art and writing are beautiful ways to reconnect with yourself. I get so caught up in the hard parts of change and I don‚Äôt want you to miss out on the joyous parts too. Creativity is the heart and soul of the Change principle. It is something to cultivate in ourselves.  It is what sparks that joyous realization of Wait! I have an idea! What about‚Ä¶And then a new world of possibility opens up.  Remember how good it feels to dive into a new project that you are excited about. How you were buzzing with all these ideas of what you could do. Creativity lights us up. This also is a vital part of Change.
