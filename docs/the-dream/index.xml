      <description>When I first started writing this I hoped that I could mostly keep myself out of this document because obviously this is about so much more than just me. I am just this nobody on the internet. I am not some expert giving an authoritative report. I am just this guy trying to start a conversation about something I passionately care about. There is no particular reason you should listen to me other than maybe I have some interesting stories that get you to think.</description>

      <description>When I look at the world I see a vast system of parts all in relation to each other. The system is very complex so we have to find ways to manage that complexity if we want to get anything done. This kind of thinking is called Systems Thinking. It recognizes that when you are dealing with the &amp;ldquo;wicked problems&amp;rdquo; of the world you first have to understand the whole system.</description>

      <title>Open Source</title>

      <description>More people should be aware of the open source movement. It is kind of a big deal. I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching it with fascination from the beginning. In the 1990&amp;rsquo;s it was not at all clear that it would end up completely conquering the world, but it did. Much of the software that you are using at this very moment is open source. It is built into the very foundations of the internet.</description>

      <title>Principles</title>

      <description>Let me suggest a set of guiding principles for this project. Something that we can fall back on when we are trying to decide what goes in and what stays out. Something that guides us as we write and review. If you find that some part of this site does not match these principles please let me know - it is a bug that needs to be fixed.
Simplicity I deeply value your time.</description>

      <description>So how are we going to do this? What does the plan look like?
The Goal First we need to be clear on where we are going. What do we truly want for this world? What would light us up all the way? I suggested earlier that we don&amp;rsquo;t have to over think this. Let our love for our children guide us. Let our inner child guide us. We already know what we dream for the world, we just have to dare to believe it is possible.</description>
