<main><h1>Welcome</h1>
<h1 id="welcome">Welcome!</h1>
<p>Thank you so much visiting this web site! I&rsquo;m just at the very
beginning of this project and I need all the help I can get to make this
something that serves.</p>
<p>Know that it was very hard for me to ask you to come visit something that is
so rough and unfinished. I truly am deeply grateful that you did! Please also know that
I will treasure any feedback you can give me. My intent is to as much as possible
get my own ego out of the way so that I can &ndash; with your help &ndash; create something
that actually helps the world. That is what is most important to me.
So really let me know what you truly think, both good and bad.</p>
<p>I have a wild ambition to save the world. To even have a chance to make this work it will require
many, many different voices speaking from a place of deep Truth. We all have our own paths
to Truth let&rsquo;s start with mine.</p>
<h1 id="save-the-world">Save the World</h1>
<p>There is so much suffering and pain in the world. When I open my heart to all that is I burst into
sobbing tears. So. much. Pain! Do you feel it with me? At least a little? The sensitives among us certainly
do. Here take this pill so you can function, as if shock and horror were not the most
appropriate reaction to the world. As if everything is fine, just keep on going don&rsquo;t
pay attention to that poor homeless person in the corner there. And our history! Generation
after generation passing its trauma on to the next. So many people growing up in hurt and lack. It hurts so much!
It can feel like much too much to take in, even just a little bit can feel like the an immense, implacable ocean wave sweeping us away from the security of shore. Better, safer to hide away from all that pain.</p>
<p>Then to find out that we are killing off most of the species on this planet, setting up a future catastrophe that could cause billions to die, and most people don&rsquo;t seem to really care. Don&rsquo;t seem to realize it for the
existential threat that it is. It is easy to give in to a
sort of hopelessness. What can any one person really do in face of the implacable forces shaping
the world? Sentient beings are going to continue to suffer in needless agony, and yes it is even likely
that most of the species on this planet including are own are going to have a massive die off. We can do
our best, but it probably won&rsquo;t be enough. It is hopeless.</p>
<p>And yet.</p>
<p>Stop and breath, and know.</p>
<p>There is hope. Always.</p>
<p>Even in the depths of horrific trauma there can be moments when all that pain cracks something open and
lets Grace shine through. When despite it all we recognize the beauty and glory of simply being alive
in this imperfect world and are grateful. Mixed with the filth there is also beauty, glory, and awe. All
wrapped up together. There is no deeper joy without the deeper suffering it appears.</p>
<p>And again I say there is hope. Please try to let that in, if only a little. It is what I want very most
for this world to know.</p>
<p>Know that you are not alone. People the world over have been working on the problem, and we are on
the cusp of a number of exciting breakthroughs. There have been important, major advances in theory which
help better explain the deeper reasons how and why we got here, and suggest an exciting path to healing the world.
There have been huge advances in therapy. We are now seeing proven, effective treatments for people even with
horrible trauma. We&rsquo;ve never had that before. One of those treatments is the use of Psychedelics. This Medicine work also opens up to ordinary people access to spiritual states that most have never reached. That combined with the
hard earned wisdom of the early western spiritual pioneers is starting to bear fruit in a spiritual practice that brings together the best of Eastern and Western thought. There have been some harsh failures along this path, but we are starting to see something that can actually work in a practical way. Working enough so that we can maybe start to dream a little of what an amazing world we can fashion if only we can get enough of us out of pain long enough so that
we can focus on the bigger picture.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t guarantee that we will get there. The possibility of horrible failure always is there, but I would not be
creating this website if I did not truly, truly believe it is possible. The very first step is to hope. Are you willing
to take that risk with me? To care? I think I do know what I&rsquo;m asking of you. Please join me anyways.</p>
