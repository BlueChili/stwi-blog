Americans have a huge blindspot about groups. We just don’t seem to get that not everything is just about me. When I try to explain this to people I sometimes get frustrated until I remember it took me an entire year of living in Japan and married to a Japanese woman to get this — no wonder people don’t get it. It is like trying to talk to fish about the water they are swimming in. Water? What are you talking about? And yet we are all floating around in this trance of the rugged individualist.  I see it in all sorts of places. It is what makes driving so scary sometimes. When I drive in California I have to remember that most of the other drivers seem to act like they are in a driving game and consider all the other drivers to be just npc’s — not real.  To stay safe I have to just assume people will act in selfish, random ways and not get too flustered by the occasional road rage incident. Again, I’m not real to them. And they certainly don’t have any conception of being part of a greater whole — at least not while they are driving. This attitude shows up in how we do our healing work as well.

Many people are discovering the power of therapy. Most therapists are now actually worth visiting; they have practical, useful techniques that really help. It wasn’t always that way, but I think those bad days are finally past. But therapy is a very individualistic path. It is incredibly necessary and useful for healing work around, say, deep trauma work, but it doesn’t have much to say about the wisdom traditions that we also need. 

 There is a certain connection magic that always comes up for a group that goes through something intense together. People connect and become one. It is part of being human. We are a deeply social animal and we are meant to form groups both large and small. We even have mirror neurons dedicated to this task.

If someone is grieving I grieve too. If someone is in pain I hurt also. When someone does some work for themselves they are doing work for me as well. This is one reason why HAI creates so much space for sharing, because we can learn so much from each other. The other reason is that when we are in a safe, deeply connected group like this, people become our sacred witness. When I state that I am committed to loving the hurt little boy inside myself to the group, that becomes a sacred vow. There is something incredibly healing to be witnessed in this way.
