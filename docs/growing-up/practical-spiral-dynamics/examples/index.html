<main><h1>Blindspots</h1>
<p>I find it quite amusing that everyone except me has blind spots. I don&rsquo;t have any. This amuses be because it is so obviously false, and yet there is a part of me that really believes it. After all I can&rsquo;t see my own blind spots so obviously I don&rsquo;t have any, right? In other words, I don&rsquo;t know what I don&rsquo;t know. Other people can know things, can be so more advanced than us on something that we don&rsquo;t recognize how much further ahead they are. So when we reach an impasse, it is important to stop and hold open the possibility that maybe this might be our blindspot not theirs. Maybe they can see something that we don&rsquo;t even know we don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>There are many different kinds of blindspots, but let&rsquo;s focus on where one level sees something that another level just misses.</p>
<h2 id="science-blindspot">Science blindspot</h2>
<p>On January 28, 1986 millions of children sitting in their classrooms watched the launch of the Challenger shuttle. For the first time in history there was a school teacher onboard, Christa McAuliffe. The networks were televising a special classroom set up for her students watching the launch. 73 seconds after launch the shuttle blew up and her students watched her die on national TV. It was a horrible, painful death. It did not have to happen. NASA engineers the day before the launch literally begged for the launch to be cancelled. But the launch had already been postponed numerous times, and if it were postponed yet again it could not be included in Reagan&rsquo;s state of the union address. So the engineers were overruled. But they knew. One of the engineers, <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/01/28/464744781/30-years-after-disaster-challenger-engineer-still-blames-himself">Bob Ebeling</a>, told his wife the night before, &ldquo;It is going to blow up&rdquo;</p>
<p>What happened here? Bob Ebeling was working on the Orange level, but the NASA administration was operating at most likely Red or possibly Blue. Either way the adminstrators clearly did not have a science/engineering mindset. There was a level mismatch. Sometimes one level sees things much clearer than another level and we ignore it at our dire peril. It is an act of moral cowardice to not call it out. Bob, spent his life regretting not finding a way to convince the administrators to cancel the launch. His problem was that he tried to talk to them in the language of science, but that kind of thinking was not really available to them.  At that time it was pretty common for Republicans to not even believe in evolution. The Green level has done such a good job of deconstructing rationality that we sometimes forget that in certain cases one point of view is clearly superior to another. We have to be incredibly careful here of course because it is so easy to mislead ourselves that we are correct when in fact we are not. In this case, however, we are on fairly safe ground. Spaceships are very much an Orange level construct, and disaster awaits anyone who tries to launch one without being at least at that level. Global warming is a similar problem. Politicians who are not at least at the Orange level are deciding to not respond to the challenge. Disaster awaits us. This is not just a Red/Blue thing. Systemic racism and systemic sexism are very real, and yet Orange doesn&rsquo;t seem to be able to see this. You have to go up to Green to see it.</p>
<p>Hopefully you agree with this? Good. Let&rsquo;s go on to something harder.</p>
<h2 id="class-blindspot">Class Blindspot</h2>
<p>I grew up in Waukegan Illinois. It was a gritty, dirty factory town north of Chicago. Unions were strong there. Everyone knew how much everyone else earned because we were all in this together. Only a factory owner would want to keep wages secret. Waukegan is in a region that used to be called the Steel Belt (or Factory Belt) because of all the manufacturing, but in the 80&rsquo;s that all started to decline and the area is now known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_Belt">Rust Belt</a>. Dead factories were all around us. I would sneak into an abandoned factory with a friend and it was spooky. The calendars on the wall were marked off until one day they weren&rsquo;t. Desks were just left as they were. These factory shutdowns did not have to happen. They were the result of a deliberate policy to throw open trade. And the most vigorous supporter of this was Bill Clinton, a Democrat. He almost didn&rsquo;t get elected in 92. He benefited from Ross Perot&rsquo;s independent campaign that got an astonishing 19% of the vote. No other third party candidate has gotten close to that. And if Perot had run a better campaign he probably would have done much better. Maybe even won. Perot is famous for talking about the &ldquo;giant sucking sound&rdquo; people would hear as union jobs were outsourced. He turned out to be exactly correct. We first set up a free trade agreement with Mexico (NAFTA) and then moved on to China. To be fair the factories were already in decline at that point, but that was the death knell. Factories shut down all over the Rust belt and the unions were thoroughly busted.</p>
<p>Economists kept on insisting that the net effect of all this &ldquo;creative destruction&rdquo; was increased wealth for the country. But they didn&rsquo;t say increased wealth for who. Some people benefitted from this, but it wasn&rsquo;t the factory workers. And the workers noticed. Hilary Clinton lost in 2016 because formerly solid Democratic states like Wisconsin, Pennsylvannia, and Michicgan went (narrowly) for Trump. These states not coincidentally are part of the Rust Belt. I suspect the insult of nominating Bill Clinton&rsquo;s wife was just too much for some former Democrats there. I sympathize. We have done them a great injustice, and the most damning thing of all is that we don&rsquo;t even deign to acknowledge it. Note that the other top GDP countries Germany and Japan did not choose this path. They did not abandon their workers. It was not inevitable that the we had to.</p>
<p>When I say &ldquo;we&rdquo; I am talking about people like me who have benefitted enormously from the free trade agreements. I was always very good at school so as soon as I graduated from Waukegan East HS I went straight to a fancy college and never looked back. I was set, but all the kids not so good at school were kind of screwed. I never thought much about them. Should have gone to college, losers, seems to be my classes attitude. Chris Arnade has does some really good work on this. He was a Wall street broker who found himself wandering away from work to photograph people, until he found himself doing it full time. He took the time to really look at America, and he realized that &ldquo;we&rdquo; are part of the front row. We are more educated and we moved to pursue high paying jobs. We left behind the back row, the people that maybe didn&rsquo;t do so well at school, and stayed where they were at. Please read <a href="https://medium.com/@Chris_arnade/divided-by-meaning-1ab510759ee7">Divided By Meaning</a> for a quick synopsis of his argument. It is well worth reading.</p>
<p>At the diversity trainings I have been to, class privilege is almost never talked about. Why is that? A pretty big blindspot. People at Green are almost always well educated. Which means they not only went to college but they got a really good education, and that education changed how they view the world. They see things differently. But college is also the gateway, at least in the US, for most of the better paying, prestigious jobs. And even if you are not making a lot of money, you are still part of the cultural elite. And Green is mostly blind to all of this.</p>
<h2 id="greens-blindspots">Green&rsquo;s blindspots</h2>
<p>Starting in the 70&rsquo;s, trust in institutions crashed. People stopped going to Church. Kids no longer went to Boy Scouts. People used to bowl together in leagues, now they were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_Alone">bowling alone</a>. There were many reasons for this, but let&rsquo;s explore one I happen to know.</p>
