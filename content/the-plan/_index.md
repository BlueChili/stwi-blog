## The Plan for the Plan

Before diving into the specifics of the plan, let's take a moment and review the overall structure of the plan. What are the parts and how do they fit together.

### The Goal

What do we truly want for this world? What would light us up all the way? I suggested earlier that we don't have to overthink this. Let the children guide us. And in particular, let our inner child guide us. We already know what we dream for the world, we just have to dare to believe it is possible. On some beautiful day the world is going to wake up in love and joy. But we can't just jump straight there from where we are now. This is where the work is.

### Integral Theory

Ken Wilber is a brilliant philosopher who had the insight that it is more than past time to integrate all the different worlds of human experience into one integrated theory. Western philosopy, Eastern philosophy, Empiricism, Spirituality, Budhism, and everything else all brought together as one. This theory is called Integral Theory. I find that is a great theoretical foundation to build upon. It explains a lot of things well.

Ken Wilber summarizes the work in a beautifully succint way:

* Growing Up
* Cleaning Up
* Waking Up
* Showing Up

### Growing Up

We all move through developmental stages as individuals. Societies do as well. Before we can change the world we have to understand it at a deeper level. People have very different values and world views. We need to better understand the mindset of people at different developmental stages and talk to them in a language that works for them. The theory of Spiral Dynamics provides a pratical model that we can use. Each stage described in Spiral Dynamics builds on the next. The higher the stage, the higher the compassion for others. Our hope is to shift everyone into these higher stages.

### Cleaning Up

We start with our initial wounds as children and then over time we accumulate more and more junk inside of ours ourselves that hides us from our true nature. In Spirited Away there is a [wonderful scene] (https://www.facebook.com/FansOfStudioGhibli/videos/spirited-away-bathhouse-clip/493650414055324/) where an incredibly stinky spirit comes to the bathouse for help. At first it looks hopeless, why waste good medicinal water on something so dirty as that. But the heroine, Sen, bravely persists in trying to help nevertheless. Then it becomes clear that there is something stuck to the spirit that doesn't belong. The entire bathhouse community joins together to help pull this thing out. And as they do more and more stuff keeps coming out. A lifetime accumulation of junk comes pouring out. Until there is just one more tug and a "pop" and all we are left with is the spirit's true, smiling nature. This is the work we all have of pulling out all the hurts and resentments of a life time to get back to out true, shining nature.

### Waking Up

The bathouse clip above doesn't show it, but what happens next after all the junk is removed is that the smiling true spirit becomes a water dragon that roars up out of the bathouse and flys away into the sky. We are all spiritual beings. After we have done our cleaning up this becomes achingly obvious, and then just like the dragon we go roaring out into the sky. This is what we are meant to do, but unfortunately many of us have too much junk still attached to us (cleaning up). Also most of the organizations that purport to support spirituality are still stuck in earlier developmental stages (growing up) that are not advanced enough to meet this moment.

The end goal is to get people to open their hearts wider and wider. Wide enough to encompass all that needs to be done. And a reawakend spirituality can get us there. When we fully embrace our spirituality we know the other as us. There is no artificial separation between you and me. You are all my brothers and sisters and even closer. This is the teaching of both Buddha and Christ. It is, I believe, a fundamental ground of spirituality. But again we can't just jump right here. We need to first do the work of growing up and cleaning up.

### Showing Up

The dragon roaring into the air is the first step of showing up. At first we fly alone. But then fly and dance in the sky with others. It starts with us discovering our internal strength and beauty. And then we fall down in awe and wonder as we recognize the awesome beauty and majesty of others. And as we truly start to finally fully open up to the world, we start to feel the pain of the world. This world is suffering. When you open yourself fully to all that is, it hurts! It hurts really bad. Yes, there is so much joy there too, but oh the pain! What to do? The strong temptation is to run away. This is much too big for one person to deal with. And yet. I think Buddha taught best about this. First it is important to recognize the pain, then to step fully into the pain. And finally we can awaken to something bigger.

#### Recognize the Pain

 First, I suggest we need to better understand the world. Why do people act like they do? It turns out that different groups of people have very different world views. How did that come to be? What does the past suggest for the future? Knowing that people think very differently, can we shift our hearts to forgive their transgressions? Knowing that the world has had major shifts in the past, can we embrace and encourage the next one that wants to happen?

#### Step fully into the pain

And always after you look outwards you next need to turn within. Where do I fit into all of this? Who do I need to be in order to best serve the world?  I hope to wake people up to a vocation of service, but most people are so stuck in pain that they can't even imagine that yet. It is only after someone has at least taken the first steps on the healing path before they can even consider service. Service then becomes a powerful healing path. So we want people to wake up to a call for service, but first we have to point them out of their pain. How can we do that?

#### Awaken to something bigger

The deeper work starts when we surrender to something much bigger than ourself. After we acknowledge that yes in fact we are in a lot of pain, we then work on accepting the pain. Fully embracing it and accepting it. And if the right kind of support is there we can learn that this pain is a path of transformation. No guarantees on this one sadly, but there is a beauty and joy that can shine out through the cracks of the deepest suffering. And that light illuminates the path that we ultimately need to follow. But again we don't get to jump straight there. We first need to look first inwards and then outwards before we can merge those into something even bigger. Breathing into ourselves and then out into the world and then breathing in again.  And then we circle back to where we started -- that childlike sense of awe and wonder. That knowing that the world can be very, very beautiful. But it takes a magic wish to start it all.
