To start on Cleaning Up, I want to visit the stink spirit video from Spirited Away again. If you haven't watched it yet please consider [watching it now](https://www.facebook.com/FansOfStudioGhibli/videos/spirited-away-bathhouse-clip/493650414055324/).

We all have a lifetime of accumulated junk that is keeping us from our true shining nature. Notice how much courage and fortitude is needed just to get started. It feels kind of hopeless. I'm not worth the effort! But there was curiousity -- I wonder what Sen is going to do? Ask for help? And then we get that first precious bath of healing medicine and something starts to shift. We still are very much stuck in our "stink", but possibilities start to open up. Huh. I see a bicycle handle sticking out. Let's try pulling it out. Wait. We need to rally the whole community for this one. Pull! So much junk! And at the very end Sen is left with the gift of a medicine ball in her hand. When we find out true nature we also find our gift.
