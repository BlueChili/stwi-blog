I have a practical problem here. I want to chart a course to Turquoise, but as far as I can tell that has never been done. This is something new. I do know the healing/wisdom paths that I found. They worked for me. And I saw them work for others. But the nature of Yellow is to find its own path. It is incredibly important to discover on your own how to journey inside. So I'm going to talk about my path because it is a practical example. And I can lay out some useful guidelines and learnings. But in the end everyone is going to have to find their own unique way.   

In the sections to come I am going to tell my healing and growth stories. Here I introduce the schools where I did much of this work. Each of these schools has an experiential (Beige) side that has people heal and grow simply by experiencing what the school has to offer. But each school also has a group (Purple) side where you join the community and offer service to the world.

## Human Awareness Institute (HAI)

It is hard to explain a HAI workshop to someone who has never done one. They really have to be experienced before you can fully understand. HAI does weekend retreats where people are welcomed to a "room of love". The workshops each have a different theme but the all of them focus on healing the shame we carry about our bodies and our sexuality. They don't do too much explicit teaching (except for a bit on sexuality), but the exercises are designed to help people learn on their own how to connect to their bodies and be more mindful of what is going on for them moment to moment.

HAI doesn't just tell you to open to love it has you jump straight in and do it. Before HAI I believed, in a theoretical way, that we all are faces of God/Universe. At HAI it no longer was theoretical -- I was loving the person right there in front of me. For real, with all my heart. And then stepping to the right and loving this one, and now this one. Feel it in your heart and body. They call the Sunday of the workshop "Miracle Sunday" because of the amazing transformations that come to many of the particpants. Again it is something you have to actually experience to understand.

After you have done the levels, if you want to go deeper there is the call to service. To join as volunteer for the workshops. Not everyone is chosen as an assistant. You have to take several training classes, and you have to pass an active listening assessment before you can even be a provisional team member. Then you have to assist two or three workshops and get a thumbs up from the other assistants and facilitators. People who really commit are called interns and they publicly commit to live by a set of principles. Interestingly, these principles are very similar to the principles I learned from another school called Hakomi.

## Hakomi

[Hakomi](https://hakomiinstitute.com/) is a beautiful form of body centered talk therapy. The question asked over and over again in different ways is "Where are you feeling this in your body?". And then you are invited to deepen into that. It is the only form of talk therapy that has ever worked for me. A typical Hakomi sessions takes the client way, way deep into themselves. They enter a liminal state of here and now. Here in their body, deep into all their hidden parts. To get there the client has to know how safe and welcomed all parts of them are. How even those pesky defenses they have are welcomed and celebrated. And it is at these deeper layers that we find where we formed our core beliefs, our core stories, and now we have the choice to choose a new story.

After you have done some healing work, some people feel called to service. To learn how to provide this amazing healing service to others. The Hakomi Institute offers many classes and they are open to everyone. They range from one day workshopts to a two year program. I did the two year program. Each year we had ten three day weekends. Those weekends felt like a HAI weekend to me. It turns out that the underlying principles of Hakomi are shared by the other schools as well.

## Medicine work

The Medicine school I attended was strongly influenced by Hakomi. It is just so obvious when working with people that you first need to get them more connected to their bodies. Get them to slow down enough that they can actually notice moment to moment what is going on for them. We were taught to use the Hakomi principles when working with our clients.

The school uses two medicines, MDMA and mushrooms. After doing some initial sessions to establish trust and to work on the client's sacred intent we first did a MDMA journey. This medicine works in the realm of relationship and body. Relationship to yourself and others. And it is where we can start working on any traumas. There is a whole fascinating physiological explanation of why MDMA is so effective for working with trauma but I won't go into that right here. Just know that it works, and there is really good science backing that claim. Then after the guide feels that the client's traumas are now somewhat manageable (they never really go the way, we just learn to assimilate them better), then it might be time to explore the realm of spirit and the "other" world that we visit when we do psychedelics mushrooms. We don't jump straight here because if the client has uprocessed trauma a psychedelic journey can be really brutal. This is how many people got so hurt in the 60's and 70's. But held in the right way, this sacred journey into self can be life changing. For many, the initial entry into this other world can be rough, but quite often they land in a place of beauty that they don't want to return from.

## Forest Bathing

This school of healing was inspired by the Japanese practice of forest "bathing". [ANFT](https://www.natureandforesttherapy.earth/) certified trainers take people out on very gentle nature walks. Participants are invited to slow down and connect their body with the more than human world. They step into a liminal state of here and now, in relationship to all the beings surrounding them. It provides safe support and structure to help people connect with the natural world. After every invitation, every one in the group is invited to do a short, heart based share of what they experienced. Hearing from others helps people to go even deeper into the experience

After you have done these sessions, some people called to service. To learn how to guide others to find themselves in the natural world. ANFT offers a six month certification class followed by a four day immersion retreat to train people to lead forest therapy walks. Although ANFT doesn't have an explicit set of principles, they might as well adopt Hakomi's. They would fit perfectly.
