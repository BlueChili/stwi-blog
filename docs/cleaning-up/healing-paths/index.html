<main><h1>Healing Paths</h1>
<p>I have a practical problem here. I want to chart a course to Turquoise, but as far as I can tell that has never been done. This is something new. I do know the healing/wisdom paths that I found. They worked for me. And I saw them work for others. But the nature of Yellow is to find its own path. It is incredibly important to discover on your own how to journey inside. So I&rsquo;m going to talk about my path because it is a practical example. And I can layout some useful guidelines and learnings. But in the end everyone is going to have to find their own unique way.</p>
<p>In the sections to come I am going to be telling some of my healing and growth stories. Let me introduce here the schools where I did much of this work. Each of these schools has an experiential (Beige) side that has people heal and grow simply by experiencing what the school has to offer. But each school also has a group (Purple) side where you join the community and offer service to the world.</p>
<h2 id="human-awareness-institute-hai">Human Awareness Institute (HAI)</h2>
<p>It is hard to explain a HAI workshop to someone who has never done one. They really have to be experienced before you can fully understand. HAI does weekend retreats where people are welcomed to a &ldquo;room of love&rdquo;. The workshops each have a different theme but the all of them focus on healing the shame we carry about our bodies and our sexuality. They don&rsquo;t do too much explicit teaching (except for a bit on sexuality), but the exercises are designed to help people learn on their own how to connect to their bodies and be more mindful of what is going on for them moment to moment.</p>
<p>HAI doesn&rsquo;t just tell you to open to love it has you jump straight in and do it. Before HAI I believed, in a theoretical way, that we all are faces of God/Universe. At HAI it no longer was theoretical &ndash; I was loving the person right there in front of me. For real, with all my heart. And then stepping to the right and loving this one, and now this one. Feel it in your heart and body. They call the Sunday of the workshop &ldquo;Miracle Sunday&rdquo; because of the amazing transformations that come to many of the particpants. Again it is something you have to actually experience to understand.</p>
<p>After you have done the levels, if you want to go deeper there is the call to service. To join as volunteer for the workshops. Not everyone is chosen as an assistant. You have to take several training classes, and you have to pass an active listening assessment before you can even be a provisional team member. Then you have to assist two or three workshops and get a thumbs up from the other assistants and facilitators. People who really commit are called interns and they publicly commit to live by a set of principles. Interestingly, these principles are very similar to the principles I learned from another school called Hakomi.</p>
<h2 id="hakomi">Hakomi</h2>
<p><a href="https://hakomiinstitute.com/">Hakomi</a> is a beautiful form of body centered talk therapy. The question asked over and over again is &ldquo;Where are you feeling this in your body?&rdquo;. And then they are invited to deepen into that. It is the only form of talk therapy that has ever worked for me. A typical Hakomi sessions takes the client way, way deep into themselves. They enter a liminal state of here and now. Here in their body, deep into all their hidden parts. To get there the client has to know how safe and welcomed all parts of them are. How even those pesky defenses they have are welcomed and celebrated.</p>
