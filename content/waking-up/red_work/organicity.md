Again, organicity simply asks the question, “What wants to happen next?” and then the follow up question, “What is blocking that?”. Let me give you an example.

I once did a series of three all day San Pedro (a type of cactus)  medicine ceremonies. San Pedro is a very gentle hallucinogen that lasts for a very long time and you are fairly lucid most of that time. I did it with the same group each time, and the ceremonies were spaced roughly a month apart with a group meeting before and after each ceremony. We were asked to bring something to place on the altar for each session, something that would help guide us in out intentions. I didn’t know exactly why but something was telling me to bring this dragon that I had on my altar. I didn’t even know why I felt called to even put the dragon on my altar in the first place, but I am learning to follow my intuitions. 

The day of the very first San Pedro ceremony, one of my fellow cohort  — a man I love dearly — broke out into delighted laughter when he saw my dragon. He knew exactly what it meant and why I had brought it. But then he looked at my confused face and quickly sobered up. Clearly I didn’t yet get it, and this is something that can not be forced. This is the first part of organicity, it can’t be forced. And clearly I wasn’t ready quite ready. That first ceremony was lovely and powerful, but no insight about why the dragon was there came up. So when getting ready for the second ceremony a month later, I asked my altar who should come with me and it was so clear again that it had to be the dragon. Again I had no clue why. And when I got there it seemed like everyone else had already done their work with their previous altar object and now were moving on to something else. I felt a little shame that I was such a slow student. And again the second ceremony was sweet and as powerful as riding the ocean up and down all day. And yet again nothing came to me about my dragon. For the third session I seriously considered picking a different altar item just because now I was getting embarrassed. But if you can’t be full honest in sacred ceremony, what is the point? So I brought my dragon yet again. And this time, in the ceremony he spoke through me.

In the middle of this ceremony our guide did something different than the other times. This time instead of having us spend the whole time doing our individual work, he called us together in sacred circle to state our intent. Everyone took their turn. When it came to my turn, something so blocked gave way in me. I am so, so angry at all the needless suffering in this world. All that needless suffering that has been, all the suffering going on right now, and all the suffering that I very much fear is coming. It is so not necessary! I’m angry at the people doing it and even more I’m so angry at myself for just standing by and not doing anything. Living in the comfortable trance that there is really not much I can do. What a comfortable lie. When I truly open to all that is it hurts! God damn it it hurts so much! So much I don’t know if I can bear it. Stop hurting people! Stop! Stop! I screamed and fell to the ground pounding my fists. And then finally got to deep, heartbroken sobs. 

Towards the end of the ceremony we were asked to state a prayer, and I named my anger as sacred and holy. It is something that was blocked, but no more. What needed to happen was for me to fully embrace how angry, upset, and hurt I am by what is happening in the world. And to have compassion  towards myself for having done so very little to make things better, and at times made things even worse. I will no longer use a victim trance as an excuse. What needs to happen is that I give voice to this bigger dream of a better world. A world that works for everyone, truly everyone not just some. And that was the start of this website. Every morning (that I’m not sick) I wake up and check in with myself. What is that I want very, very most. And every morning the answer is the same. I want all of this world in a place of wholeness and love.

Think of all the many, many school shooting. Think of the students shuddering in fear and horror next to their dead class mates. We (quite rightly) hold back from the horror of that, but it is the world we live in. How on earth have we gotten so acclimated to this? This is so not OK. It is a great moral failure on all our parts. And it makes me very, very angry. I name this anger sacred and holy. Anger brings the energy and determination to make change. Anger is a sword and sometimes we need this sword to cut through all the bullshit. No more! We to find our warrior in stand together in strength.

But many of us are scared of our warrior. Scared of the damage warriors can do. So we pull back from our power. And this fear is very justified. When you step fully into your power, your bullshit becomes that much powerful too. So once again we circle back to ourselves. Standing in power is never a safe thing, but we can make it safer by really getting to know all of ourselves. And to really know all of ourself it has to be safe. We need compassion for our desire to dominate and/or dominated. We need compassion for our jealousies and judgments. We need compassion for our selfishness and greed. We need compassion for our crazy, scary rage. We need compassion for that fear that holds us as too small.

Because what wants to happen is that we arise as warriors willing to fight for this world. That warrior is within all of us longing to be released. This world is worth fighting for. Some causes are worth dying for. This is one.

We need as many warriors as we can because there is a big fight ahead of us. Things can not stay as they are. They just can’t. Let’s go to change next.
