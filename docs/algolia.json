I am deeply grateful that you did! Your support and feedback is precious to me \u0026amp;ndash; it will help me create something of value. I won\u0026amp;rsquo;t get there without you. Seriously.\nI want a plan to save the world. A plan that might actually work. It is my deepest desire. When I tell people this they tend to recoil back \u0026amp;ndash; whoah! way too big! Is this your reaction too? Maybe take a minute and get curious about that reaction. Why don\u0026amp;rsquo;t we have a plan to save the world? Doesn\u0026amp;rsquo;t the world need saving? Yes, of course it does. Why not spend some time thinking about this? Why isn\u0026amp;rsquo;t this conversation more common?\nFor thirty years I have watched global warming. Back in the 90\u0026amp;rsquo;s environmentalists knew a disaster was coming. The science was clear. And I did nothing. Each decade the climate scientists kept on coming back to report that it was even worse than we feared. And I did nothing. The reports got so bad I could not make myself read them. It hurt too much. If you read them carefully, you could hear the scientists screaming in anguish. And I still did nothing.\nNo longer.\nMy daughter is learning about how bad the situation is at school. Our children understand the reality of our situation much better than we do. She asked me if it is OK to have children. Ouch. I had to really think about it. I found myself bargaining with God. Maybe her children will be OK? But then she asked what about her children\u0026amp;rsquo;s children? And what about all future children? And the honest answer is I do not know.\nWhat I do know is that I will not do nothing for another thirty years. The world needs even someone as ordinary as me. No matter how hard it gets I can not imagine anything more painful than to confess to my grandchildren thirty years from now that yet again I stood by and did nothing.\nFortunately, while I …","date":1608218775,"description":"","lastmod":"2020-12-17T15:26:15Z","objectID":"3976528693a0108357f4928017600865","permalink":"https://cosmosgame.github.io/save-the-world/","publishdate":"2020-12-17T15:26:15Z","title":"Welcome!"},{"content":" Welcome  Welcome and thanks Saving the world  We know we have a problem, well documented We are on a deadline  Cascade.

But here I am going to focus mainly on its principles. These principles are a foundation we can build on. They can be our North star to help guide us when we get lost. These principles work together. All of them are necessary. If a Hakomi session didn\u0026amp;rsquo;t go well, students are taught to look to the principles to see what was missing. This brings us back to systems thinking. Again asking \u0026amp;ldquo;why?\u0026amp;rdquo; to go deeper and deeper so that we can embrace all parts of the system.\nHakomi started with five founding principles. Loving Presence was added here. Truth and Change were added here. This brings us to eight principles which seems like the right number to me.\nJust like Spiral Dynamic stages spiral up and back to the same stage but higher, these principles spiral back and up as we do our growth work. In the Healing Up stage these principles can guide us on how to help people heal. In the Wising Up stage these principles can guide us on choosing wisdom practices. And in the Waking Up stage these principles can guide us into fully awakening into our full and highest potential.\nOk so we start with Healing up. The very, very first thing we need for healing is a safe place to do our work. And how do we create that? A deep commitment to non-violence. Hakomi starts here.\n","date":-62135596800,"description":"","objectID":"f55b3203f58791e7c7141bcd5b538e19","permalink":"https://cosmosgame.github.io/save-the-world/cleaning-up/hakomi/","title":"Hakomi Principles"},{"content":" “People will only protect what they love.” Jacques Coustea\n Love is the base. Everything has to be built on top of this. In Hakomi we were taught to build a loving \u0026amp;ldquo;bubble\u0026amp;rdquo; between ourselves and our client. In HAI it comes from the deep love from the facilitators and the team. They are all there because they are deeply committed to love and together they create the same \u0026amp;ldquo;bubble\u0026amp;rdquo; but for an entire room. The very first thing the facilitators do is to model loving, tender connection with each other. So people can experience what it looks like.\nWe explicitly encourage people to be loving both towards themselves and towards others. We model loving people no matter what comes up for them. No one is made wrong. Facilitators (and hopefully team) model always speaking from their heart. Simply declaring from the heart that this is the Room of Love opens it up as a possibility.\n","date":-62135596800,"description":"","objectID":"d77d480b5eb8de815efc1c8349b36b1b","permalink":"https://cosmosgame.github.io/save-the-world/cleaning-up/love/","title":"Loving Presence"},{"content":"We have this weird illusion that somehow our body is separate from our mind. As if they are separate things. What a strange story we tell ourselves. It is so not true. What happens in our body affects our Mind. What happens in our Mind affects our body. It is all one. When we suffer a traumatic event we store that trauma somewhere in our body. In his book The body keeps the score, the psychiatrist Bessel van der Kolk talks about how when he first started out as a therapist working with traumatized people, his profession didn\u0026amp;rsquo;t have much to offer. They didn\u0026amp;rsquo;t even really recognize that PTSD was a real thing. That has changed. In the second half of his book he talks about the many, many different, promising therapy options for traumatized people we have now. This is huge. Maybe for the first time since the start of Red empire we have the chance to finally stop the cycle of one generation passing it\u0026amp;rsquo;s trauma on to the next. And as different as these therapy options are they do share one thing \u0026amp;ndash; they help people connect their bodies back into the world.\nI worked with a very, very traumatized young woman struggling to recover from extreme childhood PTSD. When she told me her history I would weep with horror \u0026amp;ndash; it was just too much. How could anyone possibly recover from that!? And she suspected that her crippling illnesses were all that trauma still living on inside her body. We used MDMA as sacred medicine and she had an amazingly rich journey. She discovered a nurturing, holy connection with her body and her face glowed with joy. Up until then her body had only been a source of pain, something she had to learn to manage and hold off. For as long as she could remember her body never had enough heat and was always cold. Now she had plenty. For over a year after that journey we simply did Hakomi to help her find her way back to her body. Simply remembering her sacred journey was all that it usually took. This discovery changed her life. She …","date":-62135596800,"description":"","objectID":"7930fe977cb520f7481cddcb56047f8f","permalink":"https://cosmosgame.github.io/save-the-world/cleaning-up/mind-body/","title":"Mind/Body"},{"content":"There is a lot of truly great writing about mindfulness. For example, Mark Manson has an excellent article here. He writes in his vivid way of all the amazing benefits both health-wise and mental. But in that article he lightly touches upon something that is often overlooked. We tend to think of meditation as the only way to cultivate mindfulness. It is not. Meditation is not the answer to all our problems. In fact, too much meditation can lead to spiritual emergencies that can crush someone or even lead them to suicide. Don\u0026amp;rsquo;t get me wrong \u0026amp;ndash; I love meditation. I meditate daily in front of my beloved altar and it has helped me a lot. It is just that I have seen too many people take up meditation as The One True Way, when it is just one of the ways, and not even a complete way at that.\nHakomi\u0026amp;rsquo;s way is to simply bring more awareness to what is going on. Clients are constantly coached to pay attention to the moment. To really notice what is going on with their bodies and to just get curious. To recognize that internal voice that is always talking and to realize it is just one voice telling a story that is no longer necessarily true. The therapist acts as a support to help them lean into the things that are hurting. The therapist first checks to see if it is OK to proceed (non-violence principle) and then maybe asks them to breathe into the pain. Asks the client in different ways to get curious about whatever is happening in the moment (truth principle). And just like yoga starts off awkward and stumbling but eventually becomes much more smooth, if you do this kind of inquiry enough you start to develop the habit of mindfulness. You start to notice what is happening even without the therapist directing you.\nBuddhists refer to this process as RAIN. I particularly like Tara Brach\u0026amp;rsquo;s version of it. If you have not read any of her books please do \u0026amp;ndash; she is one of our most important leaders.

Families are huddled in subways just trying to survive, and millions upon millions of people have fled the country. We cheer as we watch the Ukranians bravely fight back against what seem hopeless odds. Sometimes there is no choice but to meet violence with violence. In World War II most of the world had collapsed into authoritarian Red. The only thing that saved us was armed conflict; nothing else would do against Hitler and Tojo. Unbelievable numbers of people died in the resistance but it was sadly necessary. What we forget is that most of the people we were fighting, the Germans, the Japanese, believed that they too were doing the hard but necessary thing. They also were dying for something they believed in. When it gets this bad we have no choice but to fight. But our goal is to create a world where it doesn\u0026amp;rsquo;t get that bad. How do we do that? Again, we need systems thinking. We need to go deep enough to really get to the root of the problem. And as always that leads us right back to ourselves.\nThis war mentality is not just something that lives out there disconnected from everything else. We also have wars in our own minds. Of course we do! This is where war springs from \u0026amp;ndash; where else would it come from? And just like those determined Germans thinking they were doing the hard but necessary work of fixing the world, we sometimes declare war on ourselves thinking it is the only way. I declared war on myself in highschool, and I am still recovering from it. In my Junior year I started to develop huge cystic acne cysts. They would swell so big that they stretched the skin of my face and made it painful to smile. They grew almost to the size of ping pong balls \u0026amp;ndash; I am not exaggerating. I went from one of the cuter boys to one of the ugliest just like that. And in my bewildered pain I made a choice to protect myself. My ugliness made me vulnerable so I decided to do a sort of amputation.

But that resistance was mostly because it is awkward to learn something truly new. Ignore what the dictionary might say, in this sense the word combines \u0026amp;ldquo;organism\u0026amp;rdquo; with \u0026amp;ldquo;icity\u0026amp;rdquo; to mean the nature of an organism. It focuses us on the living, natural organisms that we all are. We tend to skip right past that, but this principle brings us back over and over to the miracle of life. Brings us back to noticing what our living body is feeling and longing for. Living things are always healing. Always. Isn\u0026amp;rsquo;t that amazing? A doctor might set a broken bone, but then it is up to the body to do the healing. A Hakomi therapist might help a client discover that a story they are telling themselves no longer serves, but then it is (mostly) up to the client to find the new story that does serve.\nWhen a 17 year old girl who I was very close to died I was devasted. A wise grief counselor told me that we are never the same after our losses, but to know that we are always on a path towards healing. Always. I found that incredibly comforting and true. There might be something blocking it, but health is where things naturally want to go. Hakomi teaches us to step back and let that healing happen. We create a loving, safe learning environment and then have faith that people will find their own way. For the therapist this is quite humbling. We are not the healers. We are merely facilitating a healing environment. We have to surrender control \u0026amp;ndash; it is a leap of faith. We trust that people know their own way to healing, and we are just helping them find it. I struggled with this. It was surprisingly hard to simply ask my client \u0026amp;ldquo;What wants to happen next?\u0026amp;rdquo;, and to trust that something may come to them or not and …","date":-62135596800,"description":"","objectID":"1dff9c21f09c675e8a1c5cd08c69717f","permalink":"https://cosmosgame.github.io/save-the-world/cleaning-up/organicity/","title":"Organicity"},{"content":"We need to find our truth before we can heal. Hakomi gently guides clients deeper and deeper into a non ordinary state of consciousness that helps them get all the way down to their core beliefs. These are the (mostly) unconscious beliefs people have about how the world works. What is and is not safe. These beliefs are usually created by a child desperately trying to survive against unfair odds. So we honor the genius of that child for finding something that worked, but then help them see how that solution also has come with a price. A price that now maybe is not worth it. We then have them notice that they as adults have many more resources now and can now find other solutions. But first maybe they just need to spend some time soothing that hurt child within and reassuring that child they are safe now.\nHAI workshops revolve around group shares. People stand up in front of the group (usually stark naked) and are lovingly encouraged to share from the most vulnerable, authentic place they can find within themselves. Quite often people are inspired to stand up after having a breakthough during one of the exercises. Or maybe they are moved to share their most painful secret. There is something incredibly beautiful about sharing your deepest, naked Truth in front of a circle of sacred witnesses. A circle that holds all of you in love. This group support helped me to get to my deeper places. Helped me get clearer about what was really going on for me. When I stood up sometimes it was like something was speaking through me. Afterwards I would sit down and run through what I just said because it was what I most needed to hear.\nGetting to the truth of the matter can be hard and scary. We tend to resist. And there are good reasons we conspire within ourselves to not know the full truth. This work if done incorrectly is not safe. Unless we can be compassionate and non-violent with all that we discover it actually might be a good idea to not let ourselves consciously know.

People connect and become one. It is part of being human. We are a deeply social animal and we are meant to form groups both large and small. We even have mirror neurons dedicated to this task. If someone is grieving I grieve too. If someone is in pain I hurt also. When someone does some work for themselves they are doing work for me as well. This is one reason why HAI creates so much space for sharing, because we can learn so much from each other. The other reason is that when we are in a safe, deeply connected group like this, people become our sacred witness. When I state that I am committed to loving the hurt little boy inside myself to the group, that becomes a sacred vow. There is something incredibly healing to be witnessed in this way.\n","date":-62135596800,"description":"","objectID":"db15dc437614a481e6bcf03f217ad2af","permalink":"https://cosmosgame.github.io/save-the-world/cleaning-up/unity/","title":"Unity"},{"content":"Let\u0026amp;rsquo;s start with Aaron Stark\u0026amp;rsquo;s story.\n  Do you see why it has to start here? There are so many, many children that could tell similar stories. This has to stop! These kids need our love and support. But instead just like in Aaron\u0026amp;rsquo;s story the social worker buys into his mom\u0026amp;rsquo;s well practiced lies and steps back and does nothing. Making the situation even worse than it was before. It is almost as if children are their parent\u0026amp;rsquo;s property to do with as they see fit. That is so obviously wrong, and yet I think it is our reality. We, just like that social worker, want to believe the comforting lie that a child is always better off with their mother. But unfortunately quite often that mother was also raised by deeply traumatized parents and so she too is acting out of pain. Not truly wanting to but nevertheless deeply wounding her child. One generation passing its trauma on to the next generation over and over. We need to stop this cycle.\nChildren need advocates outside there families. Every child should have at least one functioning, heart-based adult who advocates for them. At least one, more would be even better. Childcare workers traditionally have been some of the least respected in our society. Notice how little they get paid (if they get paid at all). We have that exactly backwards. The revolutionary vanguard must include preschool and kindergarden teachers. Any council of power has to have them seated at the table.\nThere are, of course, many groups doing great work. They just need a lot more attention and backing. For example, Thread in Baltimore is doing amazing work but most people have never heard of them. Do not know the amazing changes they are bringing into kid\u0026amp;rsquo;s lives. The basic idea is that five volunteers are brought together with a 9th grade student who is struggling.

Finding the right story transforms and strengthens. Makes things clearer. Gives courage and a direction. We all need to find our own story. The reason why we came to earth. But we also need to find our shared story. What is it that we are meant to do together?\nSpiral Dynamics can provide this shared story. Although it was originally conceived as a scientific theory I think it is better seen as an explaining story.

The theory is just now gaining attention, so I think getting that review is just a matter of time, but in the meantime we need to be very careful in the claims we make. That is why I am so careful to tie the major stages to well recognized historical periods. That seems like a solid foundation to build on. I have done a lot of historical research to make sure what I say is accurate and I will correct any errors people find. But more than a theory I think we need a story that explains how we got here. Spiral Dynamics does that well.\nThere are different interpretations If you listen to people talk about Spiral Dynamics you will hear important differences in interpretation. Again my approach is to focus on what history teaches us. I don\u0026amp;rsquo;t claim to be a historian, but I have an amateur\u0026amp;rsquo;s passion for the subject. That focus leads me to, for example, a different interpretation of Red and Blue than you might hear from others. It is clear to me that Red coincides with the advent of empire, and that Blue was a reaction to that ruthless empire. Others might not have even thought about whether the Roman empire was a Red or Blue stage, but I think the difference is crucial.\nIt is a better explanation of groups than individuals People are complicated and contain many layers at once. Perhaps at work someone is a dedicated scientist (Orange), but at home they find deep solace in their simple, unquestioning Catholicism (Blue). And maybe their passion is camping (Beige).

For the first time in history there was a school teacher onboard, Christa McAuliffe. The networks were televising a special classroom set up for her students watching the launch. 73 seconds after launch the shuttle blew up and her students watched her die on national TV. It was a horrible, painful death. It did not have to happen. NASA engineers the day before the launch literally begged for the launch to be cancelled. But the launch had already been postponed numerous times, and if it were postponed yet again it could not be included in Reagan\u0026amp;rsquo;s state of the union address. So the engineers were overruled. But they knew. One of the engineers, Bob Ebeling, told his wife the night before, \u0026amp;ldquo;It is going to blow up\u0026amp;rdquo;\nWhat happened here?

You know to be true what is right in front of you. You are willing to die for your family. There are a surprisingly large number of people buying missile silos to convert them into survival shelters. That is very Beige level thinking. By the way, I don\u0026amp;rsquo;t think they are necessarily wrong. If I had a lot of excess money, I would seriously consider doing something like that too. Family is where we start.\nThe whole point of backpacking is to get to this level. That is why people do it for extended periods of time. It takes a while to get back into this easy communion with nature. After you have gone a few days on the trail, the city mentality starts to finally fade away and we can finally just let ourselves be one with the world. It is a very beautiful mental place to get to. So if you find a backpacker on a long hike they are in that moment probably at Beige. The energy field of these people feels very clean and whole.\nThis is also the stage people collapse back to if they have a lot of unresolved trauma and/or pain. All they can manage is just to survive day to day. We all go here when we have a bad flu. Unfortunately some people spend most of their lives in so much pain that they spend much of their life at this stage.

It helps us put into context all that has happened. We can step out of helpless victim and into problem solving mode. We see all the stages and recognize both their shadows and gifts.

Let\u0026amp;rsquo;s take one more spin through all the stages to consider what needs to be done.\nBeige So many people are collapsed down to the survival level. They are leading quiet lives of desperation. Just barely able to make it each day. Sometimes this is because they are brutally poor. Sometimes because they are refugees of famine or war. And in the U.S an unbelievably high number of people are trauma victims. People are so traumatized that they can barely lead their lives. This is common! We have to stop this. If it were up to me I would direct at least the amount of money that we spend on military defense towards defense of our children. We have to start here.

I will touch on the shadow side first. The part that is hurting and not working well. The part that is causing harm in the world.\nBeige The shadow version of this stage is what happens when we collapse down to survival mode. Only me and mine matter. Just like one of those Zombie apocalypse everyone else is just a monster to be dealt with. It doesn\u0026amp;rsquo;t matter what happens to those other because they are not really human. Given a chance they would suck out our brains so we have to fight back with everything we have.\nThere is an enormous selfishness that can show up at this level. An incredible indifference to the pain of others. A lot of the world spends at least part of the time here. It doesn\u0026amp;rsquo;t matter how much money you have, if you spend your life in constant fear you are living in survival mode. Unless and until we get people out of this hurt and lack we can\u0026amp;rsquo;t expect them to do anything else.\nShadows  Only out for themself Stuck in survival mode  Purple People are desperately hungry for tribe.

We are seeing a world wide resurgence of ethnic nationalism \u0026amp;ndash; which is an unhealthy expression of this tribal hunger. It explains some (but not all) of the attraction to Trump. His rallies were a potent drug. People felt part of a tribal whole and they were desperately missing that. How do we counter this? I will talk about deeper solutions in later sections, but possibly the simplest intervention is to get people to switch to a healthier tribe.

Clare Graves\u0026amp;rsquo;s health started to fail before he could fully develop his theory but his work was carried on by his younger colleagues Don Beck and Chris Cowan. They took Grave\u0026amp;rsquo;s original theory and made it more accessible by adding things like color mnemonics. Ken Wilber took the theory and added it to his Integral Theory. He later on modified it to reflect his focus on individual, spiritual growth which is a different focus. I don\u0026amp;rsquo;t cover his variations because my focus is more on the group than the indvidual. That was Don Beck\u0026amp;rsquo;s focus as well. He made many trips to South Africa to try and put Spiral Dynamics to practical use during the transition from Apartheid. Later on he tried the same thing with Israel and Palestine. He saw how this theory could transform the world. It is that focus that I am most interested in here.\nThis is what I love about Spiral Dynamics:\n  It is a practical tool. It is meant to be of use.

We stepped into a stage of consciousness higher than other animals. Imagine a caveman dad sitting on a rock with his son looking up at the full moon. The son says \u0026amp;ldquo;Dad, what is that?\u0026amp;rdquo;, And the dad says, \u0026amp;ldquo;I don\u0026amp;rsquo;t know.

Using imagination we could now travel into the future and the past.\nThis is my favorite stage. It is a reminder that we at our core are animals. Thinking animals, yes, but always and forever animals. Here we revel in the delights of our bodies and feel at one with our world. This is what I strive to return to when I go backpacking. We are meant to be part of nature not separate from it. There is a powerful spirituality in simply letting in the full beauty of the world. This is the stage with the best sex \u0026amp;ndash; primal and in the moment. This is where we go when we sit in front of a fire in the dark with friends and family and tell stories. This is the place we return to when we fully surrender to sweaty ecstatic dance.\nWhen we do the deep work of healing our traumas it has to start here. In the body. The body keeps the score. Animals like deers, instinctively know that when something traumatic happens, like getting chased by a mountain lion, they have to take a moment and shake it off.

This is what we wake up to in the Blue stage. We surrender to something bigger than us. And that surrender brings a profound, sweet purpose and meaning to life. Before this, Truth was localized. Whoever had the most power and authority determined what Truth was. Now Truth is recognized as eternal and one.\nGod is one path to this Truth, but not the only way. Buddha woke up under a Bodhi tree just as himself, not a god. He taught a practical path to enlightenment that anyone willing to do the work can follow. Plato based his work on the very Blue notion that the world is just a shadowy reflection of the ideal. The Greeks had no shortage of eloquent smart thinkers, but when those thinkers only focused on selfish, individual ends they just ended up with sophistry. Nothing useful could be built on that. Plato and Aristotle gave the world a glimpse of what is possible when you base your ideas on the foundation of Truth. Science needs this stage first before it can flourish.\nAnd then there was Christ. Imagine his time. Rome was confidently in charge of its brutal slave empire. And the people suffered. Christianity has a lot to answer for, but consider what happened at the very, very beginning of this religion. Some how, some way this man inspired a revolution that spread throughout the Western world. Women and slaves were recognized as beloved of God. Might makes right was no longer the highest truth. The cross which was a torture device used to keep people in line now became a defiant symbol of redemption. What an incredibly sneaky way to revolt against the empire! No armies were needed.

This was a turn away from the church and God towards looking for the Truth within. From this stage emerged modern science, capitalism, and democracy. America\u0026amp;rsquo;s Declaration of Independence is a quintessential expression of Orange:\n \u0026amp;ldquo;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness\u0026amp;rdquo;\n Self-evident means that when you introspect on it, it becomes clear that it is true. Math proofs are meant to be self-evident. This was the age of Reason. Notice how this puts the source of Truth back in the individual. The purpose of life is now not focused on God but instead the pursuit of happiness. And we need our liberty (freedom) to go and do that. Both free market capitalism and democracy trust the wisdom of the crowd to get us to the best answers. This was a very radical idea at the time, and yet it has worked out surprisingly well. Markets do seem to be a much better mechanism than command economies and democracy is a much better governing system than all the alternatives.\nSo when those American Black ships steamed into Tokyo, Japan was faced with a stark choice. Stay Blue and inevitably become some western (Orange) country\u0026amp;rsquo;s helpless colony, or make the switch to Orange. Japan chose to make the switch. This was a remarkable period of time called the Meiji era. Japan is the only non-western country that I am aware of that avoided colonization. It was maybe a century behind technologically, but because of all those years of peace and prosperity it had a strong cohesive base to build on.

We see it in the cave paintings of the time. When we stop and really look at this powerful art we can not help but be moved. These people were just like us. This was clearly the next step up in consciousness. From smallish bands we formed bigger tribes and we became bad-asses. Human population numbers started to grow and we spread out across all of the planet. And where ever we spread, populations of bigger animals like Mastodons crashed. Presumably because we hunted them to death.\nSpirit became the center of our lives. Spirit of place, animal, and ancestors. Deep magic lives in the sacred places. Animal spirits and our ancestors are here to guide us, if only we can get quiet enough and reverent enough to hear them. We fast and pray for days.

Honor   This is the stage of empire. The strong ruled over the weak. We are taught to venerate Rome, but by today\u0026amp;rsquo;s standards it was a hopelessly evil slave empire. It was very Red. Rulers the world over declared themself as God. The Pharoahs built their pyramids and other rulers demanded that their followers commit suicide when they died. And people willingly followed them into death. This is the stage of the Alexander The Great and Genghis Khan. Alexander is remembered as a \u0026amp;ldquo;great\u0026amp;rdquo; man, but by today\u0026amp;rsquo;s standards he would be considered a murdering lunatic.

Too bad about all those millions his troops killed. But here is the most important point. Genghis and Alexander (and their legions of followers) did not consider themselves evil. They considered themselves the good guys. And you have to kind of marvel at their martial excellence.\nThere is a real darkness here. Brutal wars of conquest swept across the world. The worship of the Goddess was suppressed and women became property. Slavery took root and flourished. Wealth and power went to the very top.

Molecules want to have exactly eight electrons in their outermost valence shell. Chemistry is based on this. It defines what atoms can join with what other atoms. So for example carbon atoms have 4 electrons in their outer valence shell. So a simple combination is to put two carbon atoms together to form a total of eight. I\u0026amp;rsquo;m simplifying a bit, it turns out that two in the outer valence shell works as well, but is much less common.\nUpper limit to short term memory Our short term memory seems to only hold 5 to 9 things at a time. So if we are coming up with a list that we want people to hold in their heads, eight (or at the very most nine) is the maximum.\nLucky number in China The Chinese hold eight as the luckiest number. They tend to group all of their important things in eights. So they have eight astrology signs, eight imperial ministers, eight cardinal points, etc. Our western minds are quick to scoff at this, but China has a very rich history.

Join us for our first \u0026amp;ldquo;comfy\u0026amp;rdquo; backpacking trip. Experience the magical connection with nature that backpackers get without the need to actually carry a backpack and provisions.\nHow is this possible??\nEach day you get to hike from one campground to the next. Our truck and trailer will transport the gear. At the next camp site your tent and hot meals await you. The hikes each day will last about 6 hours if you are hiking at a moderate pace including time for lunch. On flat stretches they will average 10 miles. On days with elevation gain they are no longer than 6 miles (but you can go longer if you want). On most days there are options for shorter hikes, and you can always ride in the truck if your body is ready for a day off.\nWe have planned a seven day journey into nature starting at the southern tip of the PCT (at the Mexican border). We have found it takes a few days to disconnect from the everyday world and to let yourself really immerse in nature. To accomplish this, we ask that you plan to stay with the group for the whole week. We also ask that you minimize use of cell phones to help keep you in the backpacker\u0026amp;rsquo;s mindset.\nEach afternoon Odysseus will also lead a walk to experience “forest bathing”. This custom originated in Japan and encourages us to use all our senses on a slow walk with stops to appreciate our surroundings.\nYour cost is only the actual cost for camping, supplies and gas. Cost: ~$200 (depending on number of people, max 10) plus your cost to get to and from San Diego. We will provide airport pickup as needed.\nBackpacking without carrying a backpack?

But they are not well known and definitely not best sellers. Why is that? Why don\u0026amp;rsquo;t we have even one well known plan to save the world? Partly because it is just too overwhelming. We are all stuck in the trance of helplessness. Our shared story is still way too small. But another part is that most of us don\u0026amp;rsquo;t have much experience working with complex systems. Some people do though \u0026amp;ndash; programmers. We have to. No one every formally taught me how to manage complex systems, but out of necessity I learned it over time. I learned that any problem at its heart is because people are far from perfect and you have to figure out how to compensate for our human weaknesses. It turns out that is true of all our problems, not just computer ones. Later on I discovered there is a name for this kind of thinking. It is called Systems Thinking. It recognizes that when you are dealing with the \u0026amp;ldquo;wicked problems\u0026amp;rdquo; of the world you first have to understand the whole system. The temptation is to just pick a part of the problem and get to work because the need is so urgent, but that ultimately has limits. It can help, but it will not get us all the way where we want.

So I am highly motivated after each incident to learn from it what we can do to …","date":-62135596800,"description":"","objectID":"410bef4c18a282cdfa9ab8c258817f0c","permalink":"https://cosmosgame.github.io/save-the-world/the-dream/going-deeper/","title":"Systems Thinking"},{"content":"Let me suggest a set of guidinglines for this project. Something that we can fall back on when we are trying to decide what goes in and what stays out. Something that guides us as we write and review. If you find that some part of this site does not match these principles please let me know - it is a bug that needs to be fixed.\nSimplicity I deeply value your time. I promise not to waste it. There is a lot to cover here, but I will only bring in the most important points. There are lots of fun tangents that can be visited as side topics, but the goal is to focus on finding the simplest thing that can work. Every idea will be expressed as simply and clearly as possible. If you don\u0026amp;rsquo;t understand a concept it is my fault not yours. Let me know. If you think I\u0026amp;rsquo;m wasting time on something, then you might have found an important bug (or at the very least I am not explaining well enough why it is essential).\nPractical The goal is to create something practical. Something that can actually change the world. Getting the theory right is incredibly important, but on the main path we don\u0026amp;rsquo;t want to bring in any more theory than is strictly necessary. People like myself can go off and do the readings, but then we need to come back here ready to share the useful nuggets that can be put to work.\nWe will know this project is working when we see it inspire actual healing and growth in the world.\nKaizen Kaizen means constant on-going improvement. It is always possible to grow and learn. You should be a bit skeptical of initial versions of this site, but over time as more people contribute and comment the site will grow and mature. Kaizen is a very open source concept. It is also very Japanese. You are never done with the work \u0026amp;ndash; there is always more to be done. And there is a deep joy in that.\nSelf evident Nothing written here is meant to be taken on faith. Please find the truth of everything within yourself. The request, though, is that you search for this truth …","date":-62135596800,"description":"","objectID":"e4b01eb809e6b3097214fd714a10fbfd","permalink":"https://cosmosgame.github.io/save-the-world/the-dream/guidelines/","title":"Guidelines"},{"content":"More people should be aware of the open source movement. It is kind of a big deal. I\u0026amp;rsquo;ve been watching it with fascination from the beginning. In the 1990\u0026amp;rsquo;s it was not at all clear that it would end up completely conquering the world, but it did. Much of the software that you are using at this very moment is open source. It is built into the very foundations of the internet. Open Source out competed fierce capitalistic companies because it is a better way of collaborating. It is the only instance that I know of where communism won. No one owns open source software; people freely donate their time to it as a gift to the world. Ideas work best when they are free. And frameworks work best when many people have taken a serious look at them and offered improvements. But despite this idealism open source exists to be of use. Not all contributions are accepted. It is not like the wikipedia where there are endless, wasteful edit wars over controversial topics. Open source tends to avoid all that and stays focused on delivering value. And if it doesn\u0026amp;rsquo;t, some other open source project comes along to replace it.\nOpen source does not have to be just for software. I propose that this plan to save the world should be an open source project. So how does that work? This website is hosted on Github, which is where many open source projects live. Every aspect of this site is open to inspection and review. Github supports this kind of collaboration through an intuitive interface. The Github UI is meant to be accessible even to people who are not strongly technical.\nThere are three main ways to interact with this site\nComments Please, please leave a comment below. Even just to say Hi. You have to create an account to do this, but that is to prevent bots from spamming the comments. My apologies for making you do that, but it is necessary. Unprotected websites get horribly spammed. And I hope you do register because I so want to hear your thoughts.

What does the plan look like?\nThe Goal First we need to be clear on where we are going. What do we truly want for this world? What would light us up all the way? I suggested earlier that we don\u0026amp;rsquo;t have to over think this. Let our love for our children guide us. Let our inner child guide us. We already know what we dream for the world, we just have to dare to believe it is possible. On some beautiful day the world is going to wake up in love and joy. But we can\u0026amp;rsquo;t just jump straight there from where we are now. This is where the work is.\nIntegral Theory The first step is getting our stories straight. The stories we have been telling ourself up to now have not been serving us. They have been keeping us helpless and isolated. We need to find a bigger story that brings us together. A story that gives us solid ground to stand on. Fortunately, I think much of this work has already been done. Ken Wilber is a brilliant philosopher who had the insight that it is more than past time to integrate all the different worlds of human experience into one integrated theory. Western philosopy, Eastern philosophy, Empiricism, Spirituality, Buddhism, and everything else all brought together as one. This theory is called Integral Theory. I find that it is a great foundation to build upon. It explains a lot of things well.\nThis is his beautifully succint summary of the work we all need to do:\n Growing Up Cleaning Up Waking Up Showing Up  And I would add one more to the list\n Wising Up  Growing Up Before we can change the world we have to really understand and model the vastly different ways people look at the world. We are missing a map to help us chart our way. We need to go deeper than just assuming that eveyone thinks about things pretty much like we do. They don\u0026amp;rsquo;t. Not even close in fact. And yet some how, some way we need to convince people to open their hearts wider and wider. How do we do that? First we need to meet them right where …","date":-62135596800,"description":"","objectID":"e2fe3311b96f8e275871b3078a5754bc","permalink":"https://cosmosgame.github.io/save-the-world/the-dream/overview/","title":"Overview"},{"content":"Who am I to save the world? I am just this nobody on the internet. I don\u0026amp;rsquo;t have any particular expertise or credentials. There is no particular reason you should listen to me other than maybe I can get you to think. But in some ways this ordinariness is actually an advantage. It is so obvious I can\u0026amp;rsquo;t do this alone. We are going to have to do this together\nTo give this any chance of working I can\u0026amp;rsquo;t hold anything back. I need to bring in everything that I am. Not just the shiny parts I want to show to you, but all of my rage, sorrow and pain too. Not just the gifts that I have, but the broken hurting places too. All of me is sacred and holy. All is welcome and loved. And all by myself I am nothing. I have to somehow inspire you to bring in all of yourself. All of your joy and all of your pain. All of you is sacred and holy. All of you is welcome and loved. And together as we look out at the world we need to find a way to bring everyone, yes truly everyone into it. How could it be otherwise? We need all of us.\nWe all have our unique stories. The stories that have shaped us. The stories that are our gift to the world. Let\u0026amp;rsquo;s start with mine.\nExplorer I am a seeker of Truth. I always am looking for the truth of the matter even if that is hard. The greatest gift you can give me is to help me see a truth I have been hiding from myself. This is where I started.\nWhen I was emerging from a very dark, hurting time in my life; a time when I wasn\u0026amp;rsquo;t even sure I wanted to continue living, I made my first sacred vow to myself. To make sure I honored that vow I changed my name. I did it to make sure I would never forget. It worked. I had known for a long time before that what the name would be because I am an explorer. Although I have travelled a fair amount, most of my explorations have been internal. \u0026amp;ldquo;Odysseus\u0026amp;rdquo; is the archetype of embarking on an odyssey.
