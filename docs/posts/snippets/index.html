<p>My goal is to first save the world, because it needs saving. If we don&rsquo;t stop carbon dioxide emissions soon, billions will die. But we have to go way beyond just that because in some ways it already is too late. Climate change is now irreversible. There is no going back. We are going to have to learn to share a very different, challenging world. Simply to survive we now have no choice but to learn to care for all. Some will live in areas that benefit from climate change and many will not. We will have to learn to share everything. But this urgent necessity is also an opportunity. We can chose to create a world of our dreams. It really is possible. In fact it is our best hope of survival. I hope to convince you to join me. I need allies. This world needs allies.</p>
<p>This site is meant for people who are excited by the bigger dream of what we are all collectively waking up to. Waking up to finding their bigger purpose of service. Service coming not from a place of self-sacrifice but instead from listening to the call for the deeper joy that is struggling to be born but needs some midwives.  Please join me. I can&rsquo;t do this alone.</p>
<p>So many people are already working on saving the world. But often they are only bringing just a part of themselves to the work. Many people are doing great science (Mind) based work and wondering why people are not moved by what they have discovered. They are not meeting people where they are. Many people are doing the intense healing (Body) work that is so needed, but are not aware of how they fit into the bigger picture. We need people to step into a larger world view.  Many people are doing the profound (Heart) work of loving themselves and the world. But they are learning to endure the unendurable. We need them to come back from their lofty heights and join the work.</p>
<p>For example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosperity_theology">Prosperity Gospel</a> is a very Red mindset.</p>
<p>We wil regain the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dawn_of_Everything">three primoridal freedoms</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Freedom to move</li>
<li>Freedom to disobey</li>
<li>Freedom to create or transform social relationships</li>
</ul>
<p>But that is going to take time. The great spiritual awakenings led by Jesus and Mohammed took many decades before they reached critical mass. What do we do in the meantime? Again we need to meet people where they are at. Recognize that they think differently than people at other stages. And in the U.S. it would help if we acknowledge the betrayal of the working class. There is a reason for all that anger. There is a reason why so many people in Trump counties are dying of despair. There is a class war going on and the lower classes are losing badly. Most college educated people I know came from comfortable middle class backgrounds and they have a huge blindspot here. They can&rsquo;t understand why people don&rsquo;t &ldquo;vote their interest&rdquo;. Why do people vote against politicians who would give them more money? They don&rsquo;t understand that most working class people don&rsquo;t want to depend on government handouts, they simply want a good job that their families can depend on. A job that won&rsquo;t get shipped overseas like all the others. Something they can be proud of, and feel like they are an important, contributing member of society. And people are willing to rally around this. When Trump imposed harsh (and seemingly arbitrary) tariffs on China, that policy was popular with his base. Red farmers were willing to sacrifice in solidarity with their factory brothers. Unless and until Democrats address this class divide I don&rsquo;t see things getter any better.</p>
<h2 id="yellow-groups">Yellow groups</h2>
<p>How do we help people do that? This is the work of Wising Up. Here are the wising up paths that I know to work. I&rsquo;m sure there are many more:</p>
<ul>
<li>Medicine Work</li>
<li><a href="https://www.animas.org/books/soulcraft/">Soulcraft</a></li>
<li>Personal growth courses (eg. <a href="https://www1.hai.org/">HAI</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, I think Michael Polan&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Change_Your_Mind">How to Change Your Mind</a> is a fantastic resource for Green yearning for Yellow. He was open to this work because he understood that maybe just maybe there is more to this world than the rational parts of our brain can comprehend. That is very Green. And then when he experienced amazing journeys into himself he took his first steps into Yellow.</p>
<p>Medicine work is a great path but it is not the only way. Bill Plotkin&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.animas.org/books/soulcraft/">Soulcraft</a> brings back the Purple vision quest to our own day and age. It sounds amazing. People do several days of preparation and then head into the wilderness alone for up to four days to find themselves. When they come back out they are transformed. They see the world in a new light. What a great way to bring people to Yellow. I have not (yet) done one, but <a href="https://www.natureandforesttherapy.org/">Forest Therapy</a> was inspired by this kind of vision quest work.</p>
<p>Any group that encourages people to look deeply and courageously inside themselves can work. For example, when I did my two years of <a href="https://hakomiinstitute.com/">Hakomi</a> training we learned how to do Hakomi style therapy, but we also went deep into ourselves. We learned how to stand up in the world in a much more grounded, authentic way. And my work at <a href="https://www1.hai.org/">HAI</a> changed my life. I will talk more about this in the next section.</p>
<h2 id="orange-to-green">Orange to Green</h2>
<p>But we obviously don&rsquo;t want people to stay at this stage if possible. And we actually have a pretty good mechanism to get people from Orange to Green - a modern liberal arts education. The difference between just a college education and a modern liberal arts education is that the modern liberal arts education asks you to examine the deeper questions. It builds upon the base of critical thinking (Orange) and uses that critical thinking to show you how limited that base is. The problem we face with Orange is getting it to understand that not everything is as crisp and clean as a mathematical proof. That reason is not the only source of Truth. That we are firmly embedded in culture and many of our &ldquo;Truths&rdquo; are just cultural stories. Green actually does a great job of this &ndash; there are lots and lots of resources here. We just need to make it accessible. Drop the pretension and enormous cost and make this education available to everyone whenever they are ready. Maybe they are not ready right out of highschool? Again, that is pretty common. Again, let&rsquo;s let them take those four years whenever it works for them no matter how old.</p>
<h2 id="towards-turqoise">Towards Turqoise</h2>
<p>Spiral Dynamics gives us a better story. It helps us put into context all that has happened. We can step out of helpless victim and into problem solving mode. We see all the stages and recognize both their shadows and gifts. It breaks down the big problem into more manageable chunks. It offers us a path to follow. How do we save the world? One way is to help people move into higher and higher stages. And how do we do that? The First tier stages (everything before Yellow) have historical precedents for how to move people to the next level. But we don&rsquo;t have that for Yellow. Getting people to Yellow and then helping them deepen into it has to be one of our top priorities. But I have to confess to an even bigger dream &ndash; getting Yellow to Turqoise.</p>
<p>Again, I am assuming that you are at Yellow and are committed to deepening into that work. You are not alone. Yellow is now well enough established that we can start to pull together some of the different schools and start to notice how much they share. Because you are Yellow, you more than most really get that there can&rsquo;t be just One True Way, but instead you will have to find the way that works for you. That said, there are some things that I wish I had been told. Things that would have</p>
<p>That there isthe end goal is to get people up to Turqoise. Or at the very least help people deepen into their Yellow practice. We do that by getting people to truly love and embrace all the color stagesBefore we can fully step into the full solution we need to do these other steps as well. And just like Turqoise spirals back to Purple, Showing Up spirals back to Turquoise. We will find our way back to Growing Up but at a different level.</p>
