## Mr. Roger's Neighborhood.

We already know what we are longing for this world to become. It is so simple -- just
let the children guide us. What world works best for raising children? Focus on creating that.
What horrible secrets are we keeping from children? Get rid of that. And better yet, someone has
already created a concrete vision of this world, it is called Mr. Roger's neighborhood.

If you are unfamiliar with this TV program there has been a recent documentary and
movie about Mr. Roger's neighborhood. I strongly recommend watching both. They complement
each other:
  * [A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Beautiful_Day_in_the_Neighborhood)
  * [Won't You Be My Neighbor?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Won%27t_You_Be_My_Neighbor%3F_(film))

Fred Roger's was committed to letting every child know that they are beautiful and
perfect just the way they are. Great start! I want the whole world to be like that.
I want a world where, just like the show, people work through their differences in
a healthy, loving productive way. It is so achingly obvious that this is what we
truly want, why can't we get there?

One of the reasons is because each generation is still working through the trauma
of the last. Let's consider a concrete example. Imagine the end of the U.S. Civil War.
The North has just crushed the South using maybe the first example of brutal, total war:
[Sherman's March to the Sea] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman%27s_March_to_the_Sea).
The South surrenders in shock and horror with the realization that the North will stop
at absolutely no unspeakable horror in order to totally crush them. Imagine that you are
a slave owner that now has to free their slaves. Do you really have an awakening that
you were wrong all the time and that the North was right? Of course you don't. You have
just been brutally put down into second class citizen status. But at least you are still better
than the Blacks. And you raise your children with your beliefs. And those children teach theirs as well.
Now imagine you are a former slave. Maybe you
have a brief burst of joy at emancipation, but that makes it all that much crueler when it quickly
becomes apparent that in the end not much has changed for you really. Instead of a slave
you are now an indentured share cropper. And all that horrific, cumulative trauma also gets transmitted through
the generations.

So of course there is ongoing, systemic racism in the U.S. And of course Black communities
to this very day struggle with their inherited trauma. They are not alone -- I see many communities struggling
with their inherited trauma. How do we solve this? Widen our
circle of compassion. Love everyone unconditionally. Easier said than done, of course. Whole worlds will have to be opened up and immense struggle, effort and yes bitter tears will be necessary just to even get started. But
in the end this is where we will have to end up. How can it be any other way? Unless and until
we discover that we are all one and that we love and care for each other as we would for our
very own the world does not heal.

And it is all the same work.

Whether you are working on climate change, racism, patriarchy, or social justice in the end
we are all doing the same work -- widening the circle of compassion to include all of us.
Seriously, no kidding, all of us. And that includes the future generations that have no say in
how we are treating the planet. They count too.

So yet again we ask what is blocking this widening of compassion? I have thought long and hard
about this and this is what I have come up with.

* Stages of world view.
* Wounds and Trauma
* Spiritual Poverty

I'm going to talk about each of these next. My whole plan revolves around addressing them.
