Archeological records show that the first agricultural communities continued the egalitarian traditions of hunter gatherers. Everyone was (mostly) equal still. But populations shot up at this point and things started to get much more complicated. We stratified into layers of society. And then a new thing arose.  We chose to become as Gods.

This is the stage of empire. This is the stage of Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan, and Columbus. Rome was a very Red empire. It is important to realize that this is all we knew at the time. Our modern morality was not yet formed -- it was natural and right that the strong governed the weak. Alexander is remembered as a "great" man, but by today's standards he would be considered a murdering lunatic. The Roman empire by today's standards was a hopelessly evil slave empire. Genghis Khan by all accounts was a self-actualized guy who achieved his biggest dreams. Too bad about all those millions his troops killed. But here is the most important point. Genghis and his tribe did not consider themselves evil. They were just doing better what other people (like the Crusaders for example) would have done if only they had the martial excellence. They considered themselves the good guys.

There is of course a real darkness here. Pharaohs mercilessly drove countless suffering slaves to build the towering pyramids. Brutal wars of conquest swept across the known world. Wealth and power went to the very top and if you were in the vast bottom your average life span went way down.  Much of the suffering of the world still comes from this stage of thinking. And yet. We would become as Gods! Without this stage we would not have gone from from looking up in wonder at the moon, to landing on it and driving around in a go-kart. Think of what we are most proud of as a species -- conquering disease, discovering the workings of the universe, learning to fly, exquisite, beautiful works of music, art, and architecture. All of these had to start with the crazy determination to go to that next level. We were not content to simply stay just as we were.

This is the stage of personal excellence. The dedication and courage of an Olympic athlete starts here. The desire to radically change the world is very Red. The warriors who fight to keep us safe have a hot Red core to them. We need this level just as much as any of the levels, even despite all the baggage it brings. (And sometimes Red can be very inspiring)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7vtWB4owdE]

But in different regions of the world at different times people woke up and said "Enough! We need something bigger than this! Life must be more than just the strong oppressing the weak". And  something did arise. Something very beautiful.
