# Beige

In the very beginning, our ancestors somehow someway had the first awakening. We stepped into a level of consciousness higher than other animals. A caveman dad is sitting on a rock with his child looking up at the full moon. The child says "Dad, what is that?" And both feel the awe and wonder of the world and their place in it. This is where it all started. We and our ancestors have been using fire and primitive tools for maybe a million years. We don't know when we started to use language and when we became aware of I, You, and Us. But awaken we did. We now had a higher vantage point of consciousness. Something different than other animals.

This is my favorite stage. It is a reminder that we are at our core are animals. Thinking animals, yes, but always and forever animals. Here we revel in the delights of our bodies and feel at one with our world. This is what I strive to return to when I go backpacking. We are meant to be part of nature not separate from it. There is a powerful spirituality in simply fully letting in the beauty of the world. This is the level with the best sex -- primal and in the moment. This is where we go when we sit in front of a fire in the dark with friends and family and tell stories. This is the place we return to when we fully surrender to sweaty dance.

We find that when doing the deep work of healing trauma that it has to start here. In the body. [The body keeps the score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Body_Keeps_the_Score). Animals like deers, instinctively know that when something traumatic happens like getting chased by a mountain lion, they have to take a moment and shake it off. The body has a deep wisdom of its own. But what a miracle to find conscious mind inside our bodies. What a delicious thing it is to look out at the world and be a part of it yet separate.

There seems to be a longing in modern society to return to this level. This is the level people go to in a Zombie Apocalypse movie. A small band striving to survive in a hostile world where everyone is trying to kill them. This is the level survivalists and preppers are living in -- in the end you can't trust anyone else to keep you and yours alive.

And just like in a Zombie Apocalypse series this survivalism eventually starts to pall. It is not enough to simply survive. We need something more. We crave meaning and purpose. And we start to look to others and begin to see the outlines of a bigger vision.

# Purple

Something amazing happened about 30,000 years ago. We see it in the [cave paintings] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lascaux#:~:text=Lascaux%20(French%3A%20Grotte%20de%20Lascaux,and%20ceilings%20of%20the%20cave.) of the time. When we stop and really look at this powerful art we can not help but be moved. These people were just like us. This was clearly the next step up in consciousness. From smallish bands we formed bigger tribes and we became bad-asses. Human population numbers started to grow and we spread out across pretty much all of the planet. Starting from this time the populations of bigger animals like Mastodons crashed. Presumably because we hunted them to death.

And spirit became the center of our lives. Spirit of place, animal, and ancestors. Deep magic lives in the sacred places. Animal spirits and our ancestors are here to guide us, if only we can get quiet enough and reverent to hear them. We fast and pray for days. Then head off alone into the wilderness to do our sacred initiation rite and face our internal demons. Then we return to the wild celebration of the tribe. You are back! We are so glad you are back! We are one. Tell us of your visions so that we may all learn from the spirits. You are home. You are loved. So deeply loved.

Purple throws the best parties. It is a big part of the draw of the hippies in the 60's. From all accounts Woodstock was very purple. We tend to idolize this stage, but movies like [Dances With Wolves[(https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099348/)] do catch an important historical point. Colonists "kidnapped" by Native Americans almost *never* wanted to return when given the opportunity. The Native Americans were living a much richer, more satisfying life.

This is the stage when art really took off. We surrendered to a higher purpose than just the day to reality of survival. We surrendered to something bigger than just ourselves. We are tribal animals. The cruelest punishment we can devise is to hold someone separate and solitary. We have a physical need to be connected. And as tribe we are strong. As a tribe life is very, very good.

And yet we know the story does not end here. Why on earth would we leave this stage? And yet we did. It started innocently enough -- we simply started to settle down into once place so we could grow and raise our food. This happened independently in several places. Why? Maybe the pressure of increased population nudged us towards agriculture. The land can only support so many hunter gatherers. To support even higher populations you need to create more food. So agriculture was born.

# Red

Archeological records show that the first agricultural communities continued the egalitarian traditions of hunter gatherers. Everyone was (mostly) equal still. But populations shot up at this point and things started to get much more complicated. We stratified into layers of society. And then a new thing arose.  We chose to become as Gods.

This is the stage of empire. Rome was a very Red empire. This is the stage of Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan, and Columbus. It is important to realize that this is all we knew at the time. Our modern morality was not yet formed -- it was natural and right that the strong governed the weak. Alexander is remembered as a "great" man, but by today's standards he would be considered a murdering lunatic. The Roman empire by today's standards was a hopelessly evil slave empire. Genghis Khan by all accounts was a self-actualized guy who achieved his biggest dreams. Too bad about all those millions his troops killed. But here is the most important point. Genghis and his tribe did not consider themselves evil. They were just doing better what other people (like the Crusaders for example) would have done if only they had the martial excellence. They considered themselves the good guys.

There is a real darkness here. Pharaohs mercilessly drove countless suffering slaves to build their towering pyramids. Brutal wars of conquest swept across the known world. Wealth and power went to the very top and if you were in the vast bottom your average life span went down.  Much of the suffering of the world still comes from this stage of thinking. And yet. We would become as Gods! Without this stage we would not have gone from from looking up in wonder at the moon, to landing on it and driving around in a go-kart. Think of what we are most proud of as a species -- conquering disease, discovering the workings of the universe, learning to fly, exquisite, beautiful works of music, art, and architecture. All of these had to start with the crazy determination to go to that next level. We were not content to simply stay just as we are.

This is the stage of personal excellence. The dedication and courage of an Olympic athlete starts here. The desire to radically change the world is very red. The warriors who fight to keep us safe have a hot Red core to them. We need this level just as much as any of the levels, even despite all the baggage it brings.

But in different regions of the world at different times people woke up and said "Enough! We need something bigger than this! Life must be more than just the strong oppressing the weak". And  something did arise. Something very beautiful.

# Blue

There is a Truth that is eternal and greater than us. This is what we wake up to in the Blue level. We surrender to something bigger than us. And that surrender brings a profound, sweet purpose and meaning to life. Before this, Truth was situational. Whoever had the most power and authority determined what Truth was. Now Truth is recognized as eternal and one.

God is one path to this Truth, but it is not the only way.  Buddha woke up under a Bodhi tree just as himself, not a god. He taught a practical path to enlightenment that anyone willing to do the work can follow. Plato based his work on the very Blue notion that the world is just a shadowy reflection of the ideal. The Greeks had no shortage of eloquent smart thinkers, but when those thinkers only focused on selfish, individual ends they simply ended up with sophistry. Nothing useful could be built on that. Plato and Aristotle gave the world a glimpse of what is possible when you base your ideas on the foundation of Truth. Science needs this level first before it can flourish.

And then there was Christ. Imagine his time. Rome was confidently in charge of its brutal slave empire. And the people suffered. Christianity has a lot to answer for, but consider what happened at the very, very beginning of this religion. Some how, some way this man inspired a revolution that spread throughout the Western world. Women and slaves were recognized as beloved of God. Might makes right was no longer the highest truth. The cross which was a torture device used to keep people in line instead became a defiant symbol of redemption. What an incredibly sneaky but powerful way to revolt against the empire! No armies were needed. Instead people were ready and willing to die for a belief. And the world was changed.

Mohammed is a similar story. Just like Christ he went into the wilderness to find himself and when he came back he had am amazing story to tell. And people flocked to him because they hungered for the Truth he was teaching. From many warring tribes people joined together to become a community of believers. And they were kind to each other. Now orphans and widows were fed and protected. And because it worked and answered the longing for a meaningful life, this new religion spread throughout Arab lands and beyond.

Consider Confucius. Genghis Khan managed only to conquer the Northern part of China. After his death it was left to his son, Ögedei, to continue. The south turned out to be too strong to be conquered by simple Red tactics alone. Instead, Ögedei was taught the very blue Confucian way. He ended up conquering the south by being more Chinese than the Chinese. People long for a just, moral society.

Japan had a terrible period of civil war (the Sengoku Jidai) starting in the mid 1400's. The country suffered through countless battles for control until 1615 when Tokugawa finally managed to conquer the country for good. He established a very Blue neo-confucianist regime that launched Japan into a very long period of peace and prosperity. He observed what was happening to the lands to the south as the western traders made their way up the Asian coast. He did something that sounds crazy but was kind of genius. He shut the country tightly down. No one got in (especially westerners) and no one got out. And it worked. Japan enjoyed over 250 years of peace and prosperity without outside interference. It worked and worked until suddenly one day it no longer did. One day American battleships (the "Black Ships") steamed into Tokyo harbor completely ignoring Japan's strenuous objections. And on that day Japan was forced with a choice. Change or die.

# Orange

We next come to a period of history called the [The Age of Englightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment). This was a turn away from the church and God towards looking for the Truth within. From this stage emerged modern science, capitalism, and democracy. America's Declaration of Independence is a quintessential expression of Orange:

>"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness"

Self-evident means that when you introspect on it, it becomes clear that it is true. Math proofs are meant to be self-evident. This was the age of Reason. Notice how this puts the source of Truth back in the individual. The purpose of life is now not focused on God but instead the pursuit of happiness. And we need our liberty (freedom) to go and do that. Both free market capitalism and democracy trust the wisdom of the crowd to get us to the best answers. This was a very radical idea at the time, and yet it has worked out surprisingly well. Markets do seem to be a much better mechanism than command economies and democracy is a much better governing system than all the alternatives.

So when those American Black ships steamed into Tokyo, Japan was faced with a stark choice. Stay Blue and inevitably become some western (Orange) country's helpless colony, or make the switch to Orange. Japan chose to make the switch. This is a remarkable period of time called the [Meiji era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiji_(era)). Japan is the only non-western country that I am aware of that avoided colonization. It was maybe a century behind technologically, but because of all those years of peace and prosperity it had a strong cohesive base to build on. Remember up till now no Japanese had ever left the country (or if they had, they were not allowed back under pain of death). So Japan sent out Samurai nobles to study what they could learn from the different western countries to find the best ideas and bring them home. Within twenty years Japan was making enormous strides towards becoming an economic powerhouse. It became a constitutional democracy and changed its laws to become a market economy. Within forty years it became one of the "Great Powers" and started to set up its very own colonies.

Which is exactly the problem when people only focus on themselves -- it can cause a lot of suffering. Japan avoided becoming colonized but went on to become a colonizer itself. That seems to be where Orange ultimate takes us. The core irony of America is that the phrase "All men are equal" was written by a slave owner who was forcing his underage slaves to have sex with him. Yuck. Maybe just maybe, all those appeals to Reason weren't as fair and impartial as they claimed. And what about all those people who were not white and male? What about their freedom and pursuit of happiness?


# Green

The genius of Martin Luther King's [I have a dream speech](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3170387.stm) is that it builds on the words of the Declaration of Independence to brings us forward into a new stage, Green.

>"I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed - we hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal.
>
>I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave-owners will be able to sit down together at a table of brotherhood.

>...

>And when this happens, when we allow freedom to ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual: "Free at last! Free at last! thank God Almighty, we are free at last!"

Notice how he bring us back together to our shared humanity. Our deeper freedom arises from coming together not splitting apart. This was the start of so many important awakenings. The environmental awakening. We commit to cherish, honor, and protect our mother earth. The feminist awakening. Time to break free of our sexist prejudices. The peace awakening. No more mindless wars. The race awakening. We started to fully understand how deeply racist our society is and we committed to healing this broken mindset. Later on -- this one took much longer -- we started to embrace the LGBTQ community and the full continuum of our sexuality.

At this stage we start to realize that the Rational mind is not the sum total of Truth. The social sciences realized that just because the detached observer mode ([Positivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivism)) worked out well for physics that does not mean it is suited to understanding the human experience. It turns out that all those objective truths we think we are working with are in fact greatly influenced by out culture. In fact truth can not be considered to be wholly separate from the culture it is found in. This stage reminds us to look out to see all the groups we are bound to.

I was born in to this stage. My parents were liberal, college educated teachers who encouraged their children to think for themselves. And Green explains a lot of things, except for the things I most needed to learn -- how to get out of all this pain that I am in? What does it mean to lead a rich, meaningful life? For that I needed help turning within.

# Yellow

This stage feels to me like a second awakening. Just as we first awakened to a higher consciousness back at the beginning (Beige level) and looked around at wonder at a world both separate and part of us, in this Yellow stage we awaken to that very thing but this time at an even deeper level. Because this time we have the lived experience of so many previous generations that delved so deep into the different ways to be human. And we welcome all of ourselves. Not just the bright pretty parts but the scary dangerous parts as well. Not just the perfect (and yes we welcome our own perfection!) but also the broken and hurting parts as well. All of us. The father, mother, son, daughter, hunter, priestess, gatherer, shaman, soldier, conqueror, farmer, weaver, mystic, priestess, barbarian, bezerker, king, nun, apostate, scientist, capitalist, politician, professor, protester, environmentalist, feminist, humanist, healer. All of me. All of you. All of us.
