In this section I am going to tell a story. A story of where we have been and where we are right now. A story that is unfinished but with strong hints of what wants to happen next.

I named myself based on a story (The Odysssey) so I know a bit about the power of finding the right story. Finding the story that transforms and strengthens me. Makes things clearer. Gives me courage and a direction. We all need to find our own story. The reason why we came to earth. But we also need to find our shared story. What is it that we are meant to do together?

Spiral Dynamics can maybe provide this shared story. Although it was originally conceived as a scientific theory I think it is better seen as an explaining story. A story that helps us make sense of things.

In the first sub-section I am going to introduce the theory and then tell the story. In the next sub-section I am show how to put it to practical use.
