<p>For each of the stages I am going to ask you to test yourself and then I will suggest homework. For Beige I am going to mainly suggest reading books. If that sounds like too much please consider using audio books. The beauty of audio books is that you can listen to them for 15 minutes in the car while driving somewhere.

<h2 id="trauma">Trauma</h2>
<h3 id="test">Test</h3>
<p>This is the big one. You almost certainly know on some level if you have had major trauma. What was your childhood like? Were you beaten or abused or maybe simply neglected? Those all can cause deep trauma. Have you been in a situation where people got killed and your own life was at risk? Have you been placed in an impossible situation where you had to do something unspeakable? Or maybe simply you grew up sensitive in a very harsh world. That all alone can cause deep trauma. Please don’t dismiss your trauma as less than others. It all hurts.</p>
<h3 id="homework">Homework</h3>
<p>The key thing is to get out of the story that there is nothing you can do. That is so no longer true! There are now lots of ways to treat trauma. But apparently that is not yet common knowledge. I watched an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_by_the_Sea_(film)">exquisite movie</a> that had characters with horrific trauma wandering around zombie like in their lives. I watched the movie with mounting horror. It was like watching people with severe burns suffering horribly and not even realizing they could go to the hospitable and get medical help. Please don’t fall into that same trap.
Please read (or listen to) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Body_Keeps_the_Score">The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma</a> by  Bessel van der Kolk. This is such an important book. It is the formal announcement that we no longer just have to suffer with trauma like those characters in that movie did. In the second half of this book Bessel talks about all of the different treatments for trauma. One that he is particularly excited about is MDMA talk therapy. This kind of treatment has you (after several initial preparatory talk sessions) do a “heroic” dose of MDMA and then do an extended talk session with a therapist. Please read up on this. If you have severe trauma it is the best treatment that I am aware of. But first I want you to investigate it. This kind of treatment is very close to <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-psychedelic-may-soon-go-to-the-fda-for-approval-to-treat-trauma/">FDA approval</a> Unfortunately MDMA can be hard on the body so it won’t work for everyone.</p>
<h2 id="mirror-work">Mirror Work</h2>
<h3 id="test-1">Test</h3>
<p>Hold a handheld mirror away from yourself. Take a deep breath, release tension and then slowly bring the mirror up to your face. Notice what is going on in your body. Is this easy? Is there something going on in your belly? If at any point this gets to be too much it is OK to stop. That just tells you where you are right now. Now if you can bring the mirror to your face and look at yourself. What do you focus on first? A blemish? Something you don’t like? Can you summon love for yourself? Take a moment to really look at yourself. Is this comfortable or uncomfortable. Now say “I love you” into the mirror. How did that land? Did you believe it? Say it again and this time really melt into that love. Love yourself all the way. How did that go?</p>
<h3 id="homework-1">Homework</h3>
<p>Please read this book: <a href="https://self-compassion.org/self-compassion-kristin-neff/">Self Compassion; The proven power of being kind to yourself</a> by Kristin Neff. This is a great place to start. She is a leader in this field.  For many of us this is the foundation — we have to start here. If this all feels too self indulgent and self centered, please don’t worry — we will address that in later stages. The ultimate goal is to open our heart to everyone not just ourselves. But again I have to emphasize it starts here. Unless and until you can start to deeply love yourself it will be hard to progress. And as I mentioned this is work we have to come back to time and time again. I keep on thinking I have “mastered” this one and then a self hate storm comes up and here I am again all over again starting like a beginner on this work.</p>
<h2 id="run-for-joy">Run for Joy</h2>
<h3 id="test-2">Test</h3>
<p>Where are you with your body? Is there a regular activity that you do that has your heart pumping and your lungs gasping for more air? Is there a regular activity that you do that lets you feel the strength of your muscles? Is there a regular activity you do that focuses you on grace and balance?
Are there times when maybe you pushed yourself to do exercise and it made you less willing to do exercise in the future?</p>
<h3 id="homework-2">Homework</h3>
<p>Find physical activities that you love to do and then get into the habit of doing them. Forming good habits is a really good practice in general. I highly recommend it as one the tools you should have in your tool belt. The habit I want you to make is to simply attempt to exercise. Don’t force it if it is not working for you. Then do it in a way that works for your body. It is OK to run slow (maybe very slowly) if that is what you body needs. And if, say, running doesn’t spark joy try something else like maybe ecstatic dance. Trust that your body is craving exercise and find the movement that works for it. Once you have found that, try other exercises as well. You want exercises that span cardio, strength, and grace.</p>
<p>But — I can’t say this enough — don’t do this because it is the right thing to do, do it for the joy. For example, I do Yoga sun salutations most mornings because it is such a great way to start the day. But some mornings I just don’t feel like it so I don’t.  Recently I was forcing myself to run with barefoot shoes on pavement. My running technique is not good enough for that and it hurt, but I kept on forcing myself to run anyways. The result? It killed my love for running. I really messed up. It is going to take a while before my body trusts me again. Fortunately I have a long history of joyful runs so it should not be too long before I’m back to running again. But it is a reminder for me to practice what I preach.</p>
